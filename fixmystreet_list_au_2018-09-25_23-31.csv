2,1004,Dangerous corner,General,"Cars use Elanora Rd as a shortcut from Powderworks Rd to Wakehurst Parkway. Forgetting the excess speed, this corner sees most cars heading north, veer onto the wrong side of the road as they accelerate up the hill and round the bend. Road markings would at least make drivers more aware of the road division and possibly prevent head on collisions"
3,1005,Range Road via Mittagong nsw potholes,General,"When turning off Tourist Road onto Range Road at Glenquarry drive up the hill and you will soon come across some horrendous potholes that are very deep and dangerous. This problem is along the road and goes on for a way past a property called ""Yellowstone standard Bred Stud"". The road is very narrow and the potholes are too numerous to miss and there are quite a bit of traffic that do use the road. Yours sincerely Mrs Angela McLeod"
4,1006,Bad gap in the pavement,General,"Across the intersection from Collins Street and the Princes Highway, on the Eastern side, there is a noticeable gap or ditch in the street. It looks like someone has dug it up across Collins Street, and they haven't filled it in properly. There is a lot of people having to slow down to get across Collins Street, which is where the traffic lights are, and it could cause an accident as the following people have to brake suddenly to avoid crashing into the car slowing to get across it. It needs to be fixed."

27,1030,Incorrect green light sequencing,General,"When proceeding east along Duffy, we usually need to wait for a green arrow at the Esplanade in order to turn right. When the arrow turns green, there are often up to six cars in Duffy Ave waiting to turn right. However, when that arrow turns green, traffic in Chilvers Rd gets a green arrow and cars speed through the intersection from the left at a very sharp angle at the same time waiting cars move to turn right from Duffy into The Esplanade. There have been several accidents and numerous near misses, the latest being me! This needs to be fixed yesterday."

The water runs from Empire Cir across Fitzroy Street and along the pathway at the boundary of our building (Empire on the Park, 9 Fitzroy Street) in copious quantities getting into the basement garage of our building.

40,1044,Street light out,General,Street light on corner of park in Dural Cres has been out for several months.
41,1045,Speed Limit Should be 40 & Dangerous/Negligent Driving,General,"Households in Milford Drive area (Sovereign Hills Estate) need to be educated about driving safely to road conditions. Narrow roadway with multiple blind corners, particularly towards Withers Road end. Cars flying around corners coming off bottom of hill. Overtaking cars that have reversed out of driveways, including overtaking up on footpaths, cutting corners when no view of oncoming traffic or parked cars, tailgating and abusing drivers who are driving with more care and concern for residents and other road users. A more appropriate speed limit would be 40. Signs needed at bottom of hill approaching blind corners such as "" slow down - cars reversing"", ""Keep Left"" sign on the corners near Mindaribba - most cars cutting these corners are driving too fast for the road conditions. Multiple accidents and near misses. Alternatively a low concrete barrier in middle to force cars to stay on their side but busses can manoeuvre over/ around. Possible a flyer/notice to all households about safe driving / more respect for fellow residents and road users. Council could request police to make regular patrols of area. Of particular concern is the general stereotype that such unsafe and disrespectful road use is mostly from P Plate drivers. Sadly, in this area the majority of drivers displaying blatant unsafe behaviours are adults, very often with child passengers who will grow up thinking it is OK to drive in such a manner in a busy residential area."

56,1075,Blocked Drain,General,Everytime in rains the corner of William Mannix Ave and Currans Hill Drive floods.
57,1076,The roundabout,General,It has poor visibility of the oncoming traffic heading from Popondetta Rd ( near swimming pool) across Jersey road to the otherside towards McDonalds! a low car has to wait until the oncoming car is half way around to see the indicator which holds up traffic and people behind get frustratex and start beeping their horn as they have much better visibility being further back too!
58,1077,Street lights out,General,The street lights around this side have been out for years and it is pitch black at night! I am concerned for our safety as you literally cannot see a thing! And the street name is spelt wrong in this site which is why I could not locate it with the name! Capparis Circuit
59,1078,Keep Clear,General,Getting out of this little alley way is a nightmare - post office trucks often park there blocking views also which doesn't help. People also block the intersection as the little sign is covered by trees.
60,1079,Very pot holed,General,The length of Ourimbah Rd to the intersection of Orchard St at Fountaindale is very potholed with the intersection itself being in such a poor state that only half of the road is useable for a distance of 50 metres.
61,108,My house shaking because of street traffic,General,"Because of bus traffic along beams road and the high speeds that they travel at, my house at 541 constantly shakes violently every time a bus thunders pass. I believe the condition of the road surface are adding to the problem. I think the biggest problem is the speeding buses and trucks. I have noticed cracking on the ceiling of my property . The vibration and shaking is almost constant, and at peak bus times is unbearable."
62,1080,St marks turns left going up hill,General,For a number of years residence in the apartment buildings beyond St Mark's Road have assumed that their driveways a part of Saint Marks Road and therefore they have driven very fast without looking as they actually cross into or out of St marks rd.

69,1088,"Huge pot hole, slightly right to the middle of the road, just after the roundabout.",General,"Must have been caused by the rain that we've been having in the area, but there is a huge pot hole just beyond the roundabout on Sentry Drive, Stanhope Gardens. Usually I remember that it's there and avoid it, but this time I was stuck in a bit of a traffic jam and as a result completely bottomed out my right suspension system, front and back... This was probably the largest bang i've ever heard while driving.. Seriously you really need to fix it... not only is it dangerous to try to avoid it, but if you do happen to run over it you will be disorientated for a few seconds because the impact is so heavy."
70,1089,Dumped trailer,General,There is a trailer full of rubbish that has been dumped on Nelson street in front of the retirement home. It's taking up one of the free car parks. It's been there for over 6months.

73,1098,Sewage overflow,General,"On the corner of Belmore and Station streets, just along the council strip, there seems to be a broken or damaged sewage drain causing a pungent smell affecting residents and businesses in the vicinity. At times we have what appears to be sewage overflow onto the street, a definite hazard for residents, especially children that play in the area and in the park across the street."
74,1099,Owners parking cars on footpath,General,Blocks view so you cannot see traffic approaching. School across road so kids walking home are going onto road to get passed them

It would be great to have this fixed at same time as more noticeable ones on the road."
86,1110,Street light out,General,"Street light out making the street very dark. Western side of the street, last light before Osgood Ave."
87,1111,Peak hour traffic jam (morning),General,"Due to the traffic lights at Joseph Banks Drive Kings Langley, traffic can build back up Seven Hills Road so that it could take 3-4 changes of the lights at Old Windsor Road to get through. The problem is that as soon as the lights at Old Windsor Road change to green, the Joesph Banks lights change to red to let one or two cars turn right onto Seven Hills Road. The distance between Old Windsor Road and Joseph Banks only allows about 20-30 cars to wait there. A better sequence would be for the Joseph Banks lights to give right turners a chance when the traffic from Seven Hills road is not flowing across the Old Windsor Road intersection."
88,1112,"Incorrect Signage, Eastbound lanes",General,Approximately six months ago the intersection of Macquarie Road and the Great Western Highway was modified to prevent Macquarie Road traffic turning right onto the highway. Traffic travelling eastbound on the highway and approaching the site of the previous intersection see a sign warning of an intersection which no longer exists.
89,1113,Drug Dealing,General,"Young drivers, P plate drivers continually use this quiet dead end street to deal drugs and take drugs. They also park inside the Sir Eric Woodward memorial school to do the same. Drug paraphernalia and rubbish left both on the road and in the school car park."
90,1114,Congested and pavement damage,General,This street is a main road with a massive amount of traffic on it each day. Yet it is narrow and the pavement is damaged severely. Cars are parked on both sides of the street even though it is not wide enough to carry the sheer volume of traffic due to council approving high density housing yet not providing adequate off street parking. Being close to the university also means foot traffic is high yet there is no foot path but rough and damaged sides. Very run down and over used street.
91,1115,No Parking: Kiss and ride,General,"Outside Edgeworth Public School There are sins No Parking with Kiss and ride. I understand the kiss and ride in the morning, but in the afternoon cars are parked for 20 to 30 minutes in a no Parking zone waiting to pick up their kids. Some park across the crossing and the gate to the carpark. Some do a U-turn over double lines to park. This is creating a very dangerous situation. I have seen cars narrowly miss the Lollipop lady and other pedestrians including myself and my granddaughter."
92,1116,Roundabout sign knocked down,General,Roundabout sign on the northbound approach to this round about has been struck down flat. Still in ground but very dangerous.

The nearby intersections have roundabouts except Brickfield/Gladstone Streets which is very perplexing to me. I've submitted my request to Councillor James Shaw on 26/11/2015 which he passed on my request to Parramatta's Council's Traffic Committee. Since then I haven't heard any news of the outcome of my request."
101,1124,Footpath & ...drain,General,The drain outside ... 96 virgil av has dropped ... and weeds are also growing ...i have reported this to the Bankston council ...approxx 1 year ago ... nothing done ..its getting worse .... also grass not growing & always mud ...very unstable to walk We have had couple falls already My wife had had 2 knee operations from previous injury ...concrete slab would help... thank you luigi martusciello .

104,1128,Road is not wide enough,General,The whole of Appin road from rosemeadow to Bulli is a death trap and really needs widening or turned into dual carriageway
105,1129,Cars parked in street not allowing safe passage for other cars and also pedestrians,General,"The amount of cars that park on both sides of this street is dangerous to traffic especially when coming around corner. No room for pedestrians as there is no path and pedestrians must use the road also have to go around parked cars and when two cars are conversing in opposite directions it is very dangerous. Many cars have been side swiped in this street, next will be a pedestrian"
106,1130,Slow vehicle lane,General,"The entire length of SBS Dr & Bundeena Dr need 'slow vehicle pull over' bays. There are far too few spots to pass visitors or cyclists and there are also no shoulders on most sections and poor attempts at repair. Slow vehicle pull over bays, complete with signage would help the flow of ttraffic and prevent accidents when visiotrs travel at 30km/h the whole way."
107,1131,Parking white lines in Wire Lane .,General,"At the moment vehicles are able to park at the intersection of Wire Lane and Crookston Drive due to first and second housing developements not changing the road markings .As the roads have traffic islands ,bigger vehicles have difficulty turning into Crookston Drive due parked vehicles on the end of the street.Crookston Drive is also a bus route."

109,1134,Over grown trees and debris,General,"Using the footpath that is alongside Bexley golf course on Stoney creek rd is becoming almost impassable in certain sections due to overgrown trees that need to be pruned back, the state of the foot path with over grown weeds and leaf debris also requires attention."
110,1135,Pot holes and rough surface,General,"Road needs resurfacing. It is very rough and dangerous as car, trucks and buses serve to miss pot holes and narrowly miss oncoming traffic."
111,1136,Potholes in new surface,General,"The road was dug up, new base and geo fabric laid. The road was then covered in large gravel and sprayed with tar. Les than a week later we have potholes."
112,1137,Uneven entry and exit on Stephen Creek,General,This bridge's surface should be given the same treatment that fixed Hapgood creek bridge. The south bound and northbound exits are very uneven causing loaded and unloaded heavy vehicles to veer and jump excessively and dangerously. Your attention to this hazard is appreciated. Daniel
113,1138,Line Marking,General,"The lane markings in the recent resurfaced road leading to Stephen creek bridge, is nothing less than ""Shocking"", double lanes have been left on the surface in addition to confusing broken lines and merging lines, all done with the utmost negligence, repainted over with black and washed off by the first rain, this marking should be fixed before they start causing accidents and fatalities.

117,1142,It is at end of road,General,22 Greville Ave is at the very end of the road not 600 meters as shown on your map
118,1143,Line marking,General,"All of Isles Drive needs to be marked due to the large number of cars now parked there daily as staff and visitors to the hospital refuse to pay for parking on the grounds. It is getting quite dangerous to drive around the area as many people cannot park correctly or safely (eg: too close to intersections or driveways) - this is a heavily utilised industrial and commercial area and it is only a matter of time before a serious accident occurs. Also, the intersection with the Pacific Highway at the lights has no markings or arrows and some drivers get it into their heads to make up road rules as they please such as turning left from the right lane and justifying it by saying if there are no lines or arrows that it is legal - more opportunity for accidents and road rage. Can the community please have someone stand up and show some proactive thinking? Don't wait until it's too late."
119,1144,"Road is now not to austrailian standards, its too narrow",General,Road is full of spray patches(pot holes) and is narrow .
120,1145,Storms are pit above road height,General,The storm water pit sits about 10cm road height causing a dangerous situation. An attempt to patch was made yesterday but still the problem is still there. Also this street has many others which council fix some but not others..

123,115,Weeds,General,Weeds are growing where the edge of gutter meets road just past the entrance onto Britten-Jones Drive from Southern Cross. Could you please spray them. This is a common problem along Britten-Jones Drive. Could there be a regular spraying of weed growth along our street. It would appear our street is missed as opposed to other areas of Holt. Thankyou
124,1151,Overgrown Reserve Obstructs When Turning,General,"The reserve on the Gladesville side of the roundabout is overgrown and obstructs view when turning, making it a dangerous blind turn on a roundabout. We contacted council about this and their reply was ""well no-one has crashed or died there yet so there is nothing we can do."" Also there is a suggested speed sign of 35kmh on the next roundabout up but not for this one, instead a 60kmh sign before this roundabout."

128,1157,No Drainage flooding when wet,General,When it rains the drain area i capturing water and flooding the driveway this is causing cars to breakdown with engine damage. this is from the school on adelaide stree up till glossop street
129,1158,Needs repaving,General,Street has many potholes and has had them for several years
130,1159,"Aggressive bumps, concrete obstacles and bike lines",General,"Redfern rd Minto is a wide and safe street with footpaths down both sides. Why then is the actually driving area of the road so restricted and cluttered with obstacles? There are two separate bike paths running down the road to the station - the footpath is marked and signposted as a dedicated cycle lane so the addition of further unused cycle room on the actual road is unnecessary. The roundabouts which are supposed to maintain the flow of traffic are dangerous due to the amount of concrete and obstacles surrounding them. I have seen a couple of near misses there as the attention of drivers is focused on navigating their vehicle through the tight space into the roundabout and not on the roundabout itself, nor on the other traffic in or approaching the roundabout. The Kent st roundabout is particularly bad and I would suggest also not required for this quiet T intersection. The addition of a very aggressive bump in this already restricted and difficult to navigate piece of road takes further attention away from the traffic at the roundabout. This aggressive bump is a 'first gear' bump and further bottle-necks traffic flowing down the road. Traffic can now be backed up from the bump to the school and even the traffic lights, as each driver shifts down to first gear to get through this roundabout. Again, roundabouts are designed to maintain traffic flow. This roundabout is unnecessary and the obstacles around it are distracting and dangerous. The additional aggressive bump at the station is also unnecessary and a further distraction reducing the flow of traffic. The bump is right on the entry to a right angle bend at the station. Cars are already slowing down to second gear to go around the bend and the addition of a first gear bump into the bend is unnecessary, a distraction and dangerous. There is a lot of foot traffic at the station and further distractions in the form of this bump and the concrete bumper lanes are unsafe. One might also ask why the existing concrete median was torn up only to be re-laid the same week?"
131,116,Pot holes,General,Recurring pot holes - probably due to high traffic volume.
132,1160,Graffiti at ICE,Graffiti,Nasty graffiti on side door at ICE

135,1163,9-10 Park Street,General,Mail is often redirected to Fitsroy street.
136,1164,"Northbound cars cut the corner of Railway Lane & Redman Avenue, Thirroul.",General,"Any short term observation of the junction of Railway Lane & Redman Ave, Thirroul will show that 90% of northbound cars cut the corner and travel on to the wrong side of the road. It is pure laziness on their part and could be easily stopped by attaching some form of raised centre line divider to the road surface. It has been getting worst over the last 2 years as more drivers use this ""back road"" to Austinmer & Coledale as an alternative to using Lawrence Hargrave Drive."
137,1166,Pothole,General,Large pole hole to the left of the curb
138,1168,Street light not working,General,Street light not working for a few months now.

140,117,Repainting lines at intersection,General,"Hi Please repaint intersection lines here as the old incorrect lines are as clear as the correct lines. This leads to some confusion as to who has right of way, and where cars can stop to see clearly when exiting Wallace St."
141,1170,Major potholes damaging cars,General,"There have been major potholes towards the end of the coniston close cul de sac for a long time now, making it very difficult to drive along. It would be great if these could be fixed! Thank you."

145,1177,Lane marking,General,Needs lane marking re-done . very bad at night on roundabout.
146,1178,Traffic congestion,General,Only 1 right turn lane from Leonay St at traffic lights at intersection with Linden St causes long queue to form during peak hour. The traffic lights only let 4 cars through at a time so sometimes have to wait for 6 light changes or more to get through. Problem is caused by parked cars blocking left hand lane and lack of a double right turn at lights. The council says it is the problem of the RMS and the RMS says it is the problem of the Council. This problem was first brought to both parties attention in 2012 and no one is willing to do anything to fix it.
147,1181,Can't see when turning at stop sign due to parked trucks,General,Trucks always park to close to the intersection and make it imposible to see when turning at stop sign please install no parking signage to fix this problem
148,1182,Misleading line marking,General,Line marking when turning right from Wonderland Drive onto Wallgrove Road misguids you into the Right lane instead of the left lane to many accidents due to this error in line marking
149,1183,Dangerous redirection,General,Between terry rd and bounday rd There has been temporary reassigned road markings because of the construction. Markings were not clear and had sharp corners making it easy to drive into oncoming traffic. I dare not drive that section of road at all and fear of accidents after dark for fear of not only my mistakes but other driver error.

157,1190,Pole Signage- fallen,General,"Hi, Please fix it"
158,1191,Traffic Congestion,General,"Due to there being a primary school in this street and only one feeder road in to the town from the west, getting out of Robin Street and heading into town on West High Street becomes an issue at school drop off and pick up times, there is also a pedestrian crossing around the corner at the top of the street and with the steady flow of traffic coming in from the west of the city, exiting the street becomes a lengthy experience. I believe there should be a set of traffic lights with pedestrian lights also at the top of the street to enable the safe passing of pupils/children/general public, and to allow the congestion from Robin Street to be dealt with by the functioning of the traffic lights."
159,1192,Speed in Street,General,"Due to the top of Robin Street having a round about and being slightly elevated, drivers speed down Robin Street with no regard for their own safety or that of children that could be playing in the street that houses a primary school. I believe speed humps would be a way of ensuring that speed was kept within a reasonable limit in this street that has seen a death in recent years on the only corner in the street in which the car was travelling from the roundabout end of Robin Street down to Gundagai Street. I believe the speed humps would be a great way of ensuring the safety of our younger generations in a prosperous school."
160,1193,Rough surface,General,"The highway from the Orange side of the cemetery to Authur Street near the Caravan Park is very rough and uneven, in places sunken, in others raised. It has been like this for years"
161,1194,Road Width,General,"In 2018 Council will be opening up the Frame Drive bridge to an open load limit for trucks where previously it was restricted. Many vehicles and trucks will use the adjoining Gingers Lane as a short cut to the Hart Rd on ramp for the new expressway. Gingers Lane is very narrow, has unfinished sections, no curb or guttering and no footpath for the children to walk on when the get off at the bus stop on Government Road."

164,1197,The road between Federal Highway and Morisset Road is extremely dangerous.,General,"This road (single lane in both directions) is full of pot holes which regularly appear, especially after rain. The road is in dreadful condition and is used as a bypass by heavy vehicles which travel far in excess of the speed limit. Over many years the dangerous conditions of the road have been regularly reported to TAMS who make no effort to improve the conditions."
165,1198,Traffic lights malfunctioning,General,The traffic lights on this intersection seem to be missing their rythym it has nearly caused a few accidents and has caused an accident that I was involved in
166,1199,Dangerous traffic light,General,Crossing this traffic light is dangerous in two senses. First there is a forty centimetre curb which I have seen elderly people and children struggle with. Second the traffic light is set up so that cars turning left from Benson St onto High street goes green before the pedestrians have reached the middle island. On more than one occasion I have seen cars having to stop suddenly because they thought they had right of way and pedestrians where still legitimately crossing.
167,12,Parking Sign Wrong,Road Signs,"Parking Sign says 1 hour parking, but points towards driveway that is in use 24hrs."
168,120,Weeds and Nails,General,"Along Giles Street in front of, and around, the Aspire Apartment complex (No.71), there are a number of trees along the sidewalks in garden beds. The garden beds are full of weeds and in some cases builders nails from the building work in nearby areas. The garden beds need to be weeded, more topsoil applied and mulch or ground cover for protection. I addition the area would benefit from some aesthetically appropriate bins for rubbish collection."
169,1200,Dangerous road crossing,General,Whenever I am at this location there are people crossing Sir Fred Schonell Drive. I estimate dozens of people cross this dual carriage way (with no central reservation) that divides a suburban neighbourhood. The nearest crossing for pedestrians is 80 to 100 metres away. Cars travel very fast down this road. It is a disaster waiting to happen.
170,1201,Street light in laneways not working,General,Street light that used to illuminate a walkway between Burraly Court and Marou Place in Ngunnawal is not working. This light has not operated for many months if not years.

182,1217,Hoons Speeding and Doing Burnouts Daily Lots of Kids in Street,General,"Mikkelsen Ave has become a haven for hoons speeding and even more criminal are the frequent burn-outs using the intersection of Mikkelsen and D'Urville. Tyre tracks of burn-outs are in-graved at this intersection and it is clearly visible and evident this happens alot. We suspect these hoons don't live to far away and is using this intersection as a test track frequently with different cars (they must have a hoon club or something. This is safety issue, not only are there burn-outs but dangerous speeding. Let me tell you about this street, there are so many young kids that if you walked passed you would think they are coming out of the drain. It's families with young kids in this street that deserve safety and peace and quite. You hear burn-outs at 11-12 at night, and after smell of burnt rubber that linkers, you hear babies cry. I propose the council set-up a roundabout and put speed humps in the streets concern."
183,1218,Damaged road surface and pot holes,General,I have reported to the RMS the very dangerous ad rough road surface at the entry in lane 1 southbound in the runway tunnel at Sydney Airport. The road is so rough that it throws your steering. RMS have done nothing and there are NO warning signs.

Cars should park in Nursery Street according to their hose numbers, one day the odd numbers and one day the even numbers thus making Nursery Street wide enough for emergency vehicles to drive through, especially Fire Brigade vehicles."

193,1231,Between Brimbin road & Old Lansdowne Road corners surfaceproblems,General,"Extremely rough, uneven surface which causes cars to violently rock side to side, throwing passengers around & causing drivers to try to miss such areas & drive mainly down the more-even surface in the middle of the road.With sharp corners each end of this strip, & with limited view of traffic, this practice is an accident waiting to happen. Council patches potholes & that is about all the attention that is given. Because Ms Machin knows this area I would love to show her just what I mean about the road & perhaps have her drive along the offending strip."
194,1232,Willis Lane between Middle St & Meeks St KINGSFORD NSW 2032,General,"Electricity Lamp Post is out. Continuous dumping by people from and out of the area. Randwick Council started to work on it 2 years ago and then stopped and the rest of the work on the lane was never completed just neglected! Need to educate Owners and Tenants. Street cameras should be used to fine people for dumping, fridges, washing machines, cupboards etc... Also cars park in the lane way."
195,1233,Misuse of signage,General,"Brighton Ave is a high use carriageway that has both concealed driveways and crests. The council has decided to implement ""no stopping"" areas for the length of the avenue between Jarret St and Victory Parade. This distance is approximately 250 metres. They have erected 32 ""no stopping"" signs in this distance. Why did not the council use the standard of the unbroken yellow line along the kerb to delineate the area rather then create more risk by placing signs that both draw attention from the road but also increases risk to cyclists, pedestrians and motorists. Obviously less metal post mounted on the kerb would be safer, cheaper and less visual pollution."
196,1234,Mowing of grass around Casey market town,General,Hi can you please arrange to mow the grass around Casey market town. The grass at the roundabout off Clarrie Hermes drive onto kingsland parade the area that joins kingsland parade to Dalkin crescent and also dalkin crescent. It really lets the area down. Thank you

200,1238,Severely degraded road surface,General,"The road surface along the entirety of Kendall Rd, Empire Bay is unacceptable bad and needs urgent repair."
201,1239,Need for a stop sign,General,"The intersection of Greenfield Rd and Rickard Rd, Empire Bay, is in dire need of a STOP sign the slow traffic down as it nears the intersection. The 50 km speed limit is regularly flouted and a STOP sign will help reduce the risk of a collision. Also, there needs to be more signage and road painted speed signs to remind motorists of the speed limit."
202,124,Traffic Light Right turn arrow,General,It took a petition to get traffic lights installed here. now we need the traffic lights to be configured correctly......it desparately needs a right turn arrow.

205,1243,Road Blocks For peppermint park,General,"Constant vandalism, street racing, dumping of rubbish, paint, burnt couches etc within peppermint park area. Street racing occurs most weekends on or around the park on langford drive, with limited lighting and no road block to stop cars going into the park and killing the wildlife and destroying the park itself. maybe CCTV, better lightning, blocks to stop cars entering the park."
206,1244,Pot hole central,General,Due to high traffic area the street is filled with constant large pot holes. Surprised not more is claimed against the council for tyre damage. more displays of 50kms zone as the street is full of children and we have allot of seeding drivers going up and down the street.
207,1245,Major highway needs updating,General,Central coast highway kariong hill is a major highway. Has major traffic in both directions and is bumper to bumper during peak hours. Needs to be updated to use as a motorway not an old outdated highway with little traffic. There are no safety signs if breakdown or accident on the hill until we are literally on top of the accident. and we see children and bike riders taking lives into danger getting up and down the hill
208,1246,Streetlights constantly on,General,The streetlights in the section of Athlon Drive at Beasley Street have been on constantly for well over a month.
209,1247,Potholes,General,Potholes as you turn into Airlie Street. Lightly repaired each time it rains but need to be fully repaired with new hotmix road base as has been done in other areas of this street.
210,1248,Line Marking Required,General,"Sharp turn on Aberfeldy Crescent near Hebridges Place, creates a blind spot driving in both directions. As there is no line marking in the middle vehicles tend to drive in the middle of the road. I have seen a few near-miss incidents of head on collusion."
211,1249,"Over 10,000 cars, trucks and buses use this one way, four metre wide, residential street every day. RMS maximum recommendation is 2000 cars per day. This is getting worse.",General,"Mary St, St Peters is a single lane, one way street between the Princes Highway and Unwins Bridge Road St Peters. Since the development of IKEA and the light industrial site in Mary St we residents have been inundated with cars, buses and trucks. With the opening of hundreds of apartments in Ricketty St there will be hundreds of vehicles more as this is the only access to go west to the Metro Shjopping Centre etc. The Council needs to look at the impact of all related developments in the area when allowing development applications. Mary St must be the most abused road in Australia."
212,125,Access right turn out of the street,General,Access from lower MacMillan Street is difficult and lengthy at times. Aroundabout at nearby Brady's Corner on Frenchs Forest Road would ease the problem.
213,1250,Smashed glass on bus stop,General,Oxford St Near Moncur St Stop ID: 202148 Smashed glass on bus stop
214,1251,Noisy metal plate,General,There is a square metal plate covering something (not sure what) on the road in front of our house. When cars drive over it there is a loud noise as the plate moves. I would love the plate to be re-seated so that it is no longer noisy when driven over.
215,1252,"Pot holes, patchy road",General,The whole road all the way fromatcham rd to The main Entrance rd is patchy with potholes and extremely bumpy to drive on. My elderly cousin is too scared to drive on it because the bumps rip the stearing wheel around and hurt her wrists.

219,1258,Pedestrian Crossing needs repair,General,The pedestrian crossing on Duke Street (near Evaline Street) is in very very poor condition and I am in appalled that the council has not maintained this. Paint is not that expensive surely. I have used this crossing many times and most cars won't stop because they don't see the Zebras markings on the speed hump. Also where is the bright pedestrian light overhead for night visibility? Could you please fix this as someone is going to get killed if nothing is done soon. Thank you for reading this.
220,1259,Road surface rough and dangerous,General,"Road surface broken and rough, semi trailers have to pull up at bridge due to bridge being on awkward corner"
221,126,Deplorable state of Tinderry Road,General,"As you well know, this road is full of pot holes and corrugations. The low level crossing at Michelago Creek is in appalling condition and has been for years yet nothing done to rectify it bar spreading a bit of gravel over the top to cover the exposed reo. The first decent rain washed that away. There are pot holes in the cement of the crossing and the approach either side is dangerous. The first 4 km of this road is beyond just grading. There are areas where you cannot avoid pot holes as they are from one side of the road to the other. Most of the sheeting gravel had been pushed to the sides of the road which means the main vehicle path is down to bed rock. This road needs more work that just simply grading the gravel back onto the road as if that is all that is done, the road will deteriorate rapidly again. There are a lot of trucks using this road as well as local traffic yet it does not receive very much attention at all. Grading it once a year is not good enough. There are no guide posts on this section of road. The take off drains in some spots go up hill."
222,1260,Advertising sign obstructing footpath and pedestrian crossing,General,"Archer Hotel, 60 O'Connell Street, North Adelaide. Seems to happen most evenings and late afternoon. The Archer Hotel positions an A-Frame Sign in the where the footpath for Archer Street and O'Connell Street intersect affecting people crossing two legs of the O'Connell Street and Archer Street intersection. http://www.adelaidecitycouncil.com/ city-business/ business-responsibilities/ permits-licences-for-business/ objects-on-footpath/ See policy - Operating Guidelines, Setback and Clearance Summary Table, ""Adjacent to bus, taxi and loading zones, construction sites, disabled access car parking spaces and pedestrian crossings Not permitted"""

It causes a considerable puddle at the Langridge St end. Doesn't appear to be adversely impacting anyone but certainly is a great waste of water."
225,1263,"Broken kerb infront of 1 ennis place, lalor park",General,"A large concrete chunk of the kerb/gutter has broken away and someone has moved it onto the grass. As a result, earth and grass is spilling into the street gutter blocking the flow of rain in the gutter. This has been an issue for many years but has recently become worse."

230,1269,Boat on trailer parked on Queen Street opposite Arlinton Street,General,"A trailer boat has been parked for several weeks and prior to that a car, at the top of the T intersection where Arlington Street meets Queens Road. Queens Road is a major thoroughfare carrying traffic to the City West Link. Arlington Street carries traffic from Queens St to Parramatta Road and Croydon Road. The vehicles are parked in such a way as to prevent through traffic passing vehicles turning right into Arlington Street, with a consequence that a considerable traffic jam can be caused by one vehicle turning right into Arlington Street. I have held mu licence for 50 years and seems to remember that at one state it was illegal to park at the top of a T intersection in any way that blocked through traffic from passing a vehicle making a right hand turn."
231,127,"Tree,s",General,"Trees planted on footpath are overgrown ,blocking footpath and roadway"

I was carrying a bottle in my right hand, it smashed as I landed and I sustained two deep cuts to my left hand which wax extended to protect my fall. That night I had to locate and attend an emergency department at Concord Hospital, the arm was treated superficially and immobilised in a cast as there was glass deeply embedded in a cut; then return to the hospital for the whole of the next day prepped and awaiting a general anaesthetic and plastic surgery to clean the wounds thoroughly and remove a large piece of glass. This affected my holiday; along with shock and discomfort, it meant that I had to change flights, as I was booked to fly to Hobart on Monday but medically unready to fly. I will follow up with the Canada Bay Council as I am unhappy about what happened for myself through no fault of my own, and what could happen for other pedestrians, such as a father I saw walking up the street briskly with his toddler on his shoulders, or frail elders.

377,176,Blocked drains,General,Clear the drains which has been blocked by Karabar High School students who throw rubbish into the drains
378,177,Pot holes,General,"There are potholes and the road is uneven out the front of my place, No 14 as this is where the school bus's stop to pick up and drop down"
379,178,Line Pine Avenue Umina Beach,General,I drive daily along Lone Pine Avenue Umina Beach and the road is terrible. The road is covered with potholes and bad edges. Almost daily I have to come to a stop on the side of the road while waiting for other traffic to pass as they drive in the middle of the road to avoid potholes. Not only is the road in terrible condition it is getting more and more dangerous every day. I can't believe in 2014 a main road like this is still has no guttering. Once again the peninsula roads are neglected.
380,179,Condition of a Road,General,"Grosvenor Rd is in a terrible state. The repairs are taking ages, there are no warning signs about all the large cracks and fissures in the road. Traffic has to slow right down, all without any warning at all. I would have thought that KMC thought it was important to advise road users of the conditions well in advance."
381,18,Parking on verge/ street lighting at basketball court/ playground (cnr spark and mckenzie),General,First request cars parking on verge all along bedford street making it hard to get through with stroller - could it be one way? second request great basketball court and playground - loads of young people/ families come and use it but could we have better lighting and some shaded seating?
382,180,Parking on crest of street,General,Cars are parking on both sides of John Bull Street on the crest of the road making only enough room for one car to travel along this area. This situation was meant to be rectified by Queanbeyan City Council to make parking on one side only so traffic could pass safely. To date nothing has been done and it is only a matter of time before a head on accident will occur - this needs to be addressed as a matter of urgency.
383,181,Beechwood Rd from racecourse to Beechwood school,General,"There are more spray patches than road surface and is extremely bumpy and dangerous, very narrow in places"
384,182,Bumpy road surface on Lyons Rd Russell Lea,General,"Hi there, There is a bumpy road surface in front of my house on Lyons Rd Russell Lea. This virtually invisible uneven road surface make all trucks and utes jump and generates a lot of noise if they have loose cages/gates, trade tools, materials or boxes on their tray. As they speed past my house, this jumping motion generates very loud and disturbing sound continuously due to non stop heavy traffic. Thanking you in advance for considering my problem."
385,183,Dent on the road,General,There are two big dent on the middle lane of Kingsgrove Road just right before and then after Commercial Road.
386,184,Road construction,General,No one is working since January. Barricade every where. Just want to know when this project will be finished.
387,185,Road not fixed properly,General,On the Myrtle street at the corner of the Massa place the road was digged and replaced but the replacement was not proper. A dip on the road and causing vehicles turning from Massa place to Myrtle to go through kind of pot hole effect.
388,186,Poor condition of the High street,General,"On the Great Western Highway from the Parker street traffic lights towards Penrith, the part of the road between the traffic light and the Penrith High school seem to be the High Street which has been in very poor conditions with many huge bumps and surely damaging the suspensions of the thousands motor vehicles travelling. I have been in the area now for 25 years and that part of the road has never been repaired or resurfaced as far as I remember."
389,187,Campbell avenue Burradoo,General,Our street is gravelly. Near the intersection with Links road is the worst part.
390,188,Greig Place Engadine,General,My street doesn't appear on the map.
391,189,Abandoned trailer ( not registered),General,The trailer has been there for about a month. It is parked dangerously.
392,19,Weeds on footpath out of control,General,Weeds are growing waist-high on the footpath at the end of Church street (growing through the cracks in the asphalt).
393,190,"Old Northern Road, Dural to Glenorie",General,"Uneven road and pot holes, every time the road is resurfaced within 4-6 months pot holes appear."
394,191,Surface on sides on road,General,"Because the street has no guttering, and only dirt and gravel on the sides of the road. Whenever it rains the dirt gets washed away and the gravel often gets washed across the road causing a hazzard. Also the erosion is starting to cause hazzards from driveways with the levels getting lower and lower from the property height"
395,192,Surface of Sutton Road breaking up,General,Sutton road Ashcroft is a very well traveled road with buses and heavy trucks using this road every day. I have seen side streets being patched; another mess but this main road has had no attention for at lest 25 years. It needs a total resurface as the existing surface is cracking up and the under-base can be seen coming through the cracks as a cray sludge.
396,193,Dangerous corner,General,I am always wary driving down Grosvenor Rd on my way to work in the morning because of the near misses I have seen. There is a blind corner and sometimes the traffic is backed up the road. Cars and trucks fly around the corner then have to slam on the brakes as they come upon a line of cars not moving. One day late last year I was sitting there and a truck came tearing down the road towards my stationary car. I had nothing to do except edge my car forward a little. The poor truck went onto the other side of the road (thankfully nothing was coming the opposite direction) to stop plowing into the back of me (and causing a multi car pile up).
397,194,Galston Gorge (Galston Road),General,Galston Gorge is the link between Hills area and Hornsby. I travel through the Gorge five days a week. The road is very uneven and lots of pot holes are occurring. It has been like this for the past 5 or so years. The road is only closed for vegetation clearing and once when the heritage bridge was in danger of collapse. This road require new surfacing especially travelling through the six hairpin corners.
398,195,Street Light,General,Street light not working
399,196,Dark Street,General,"I have to walk home in the evenings along the recently upgraded section of Warnervale Rd, Hamlyn Terrace. I find it very dark as there seems to be no street lighting available"
400,197,Motorcycle parking,General,"With the increase in the number of cafes and retail stores in this precinct, along with the number of people taking up motorcycle and scooter riding, there is an urgent need in this area to establish parking facilities specific for motorcycle and scooters. There is sufficient space between the last demarcated car space and the traffic lights to establish some bays."
401,198,Road Damage (Pot holes and wash outs),General,Council works were carried out on the road last year and no resurfacing done. With all the rain and heavy transport (sheep and cattle trucks) the dirt fill ins and existing pot holes have gotten larger. Perhaps some fill in could be done.
402,199,"Too many potholes, uneven surface",General,Needs to bo completely re surfaced along the road from about Eastern Av to Tarro Pub
403,20,Significant number of large potholes,General,This section of Bayview st near Warners Bay rd had a large number of very big pot holes continually
404,200,Road Condition,General,"It should be brought to Council's attention the road condition of Ingle Ring Culburra Beach.Road tar surface is in 2 different widths & where the road narrows there is a gravel shoulder which is dangerous to pedestrians. (No footpaths to walk on so have no alternative than to walk on the road especdially of a night. On 8th June my brother was walking along the side of the road in night time conditions & where the road narrows into the gravel section fell heavily onto the gravel surface injuring his hand, face & shoulder. No work has been done on this road to my knowledge for over 10 years & request Council seriously take a look at it. There are many elderly residents living in this street & they do not all have cars & must walk to medical centre at the end of the street & also to the shops. From a very concerned ratepayer."
405,201,Stormwater,General,"During persistent or heavy rain, storm water running down the street will then continue down our driveway often bringing topsoil and gravel which will clog up our drains and cause flooding."
406,202,"Afternoon Peak Gridlock, Vimiera & Epping Rds Marsfield",General,"Traffic heading south on Vimiera Rd from Waterloo Rd during PM peak ignore a ""Do Not Obstruct Driveway"" sign adjacent to the driveway servicing 120 units at No 192-200 Vimiera Rd. This blocking of the driveway prevents traffic heading north from turning right into the driveway causing a blockage to all northbound traffic entering Vimiera Rd. This causes gridlock on busy Epping Road (already congested by the 3-2 lane constriction west of Vimiera Rd) and also northbound traffic on Vimiera Rd, south of Epping Rd. The ""Do not obstruct... "" sign is obscured by a Bus Stop sign also adjacent to the driveway and so, especially at night, is impossible to be seen by the southbound traffic. Moving either sign would help, however I imagine a painted [//Keep Clear\\] on the southbound lanes of Vimiera Rd would have more effect. A driver questioned at night about ignoring the sign replied, ""What driveway, where??"""
407,203,"Patricia Street, Killarney Vale NSW 2261",General,"The road surface on Patricia Street from the intersection with Main Street up past the top of the hill on Patricia Street is in a vary bad state of repair. The road surface is very uneven, and it is a mess of patched potholes on patched potholes. Part of the cause might be a leaking water main or perhaps an underground spring forcing it's way to the surface as there is evidence of water coming to the surface on the northern side of Patricia Street just near the intersection with Avery Street."
408,204,Fix the street,General,Ives Avenue also needs a pavement for pedestrian walking. it is dangerous to cross or walk the street with baby strollers. too many times i have been honked or shouted by drivers because im sharing the road with the motorists. appreciate if this can be provided as the road is busy during the day time.
409,206,Speeding in side street 50km/h zone,General,"Hitchcock st provides a shortcut between St Albans Rd and Fellmongers Rd. This shortcut is used by students of the Gordon Tafe and people travelling home in the afternoons as a way of avoiding the fellmongers rd and boundary rd round about which gets extremely congested from 3:30pm - 5:30pm weekdays. All day, every day people speed down this street. There are lots of families with young children in the street, it’s only a matter of time before the inevitable happens. I have been in the street 3 years and already I’ve seen 4 cars lose control on the corner halfway down Hitchcock st, 3 of which ended up in someone’s front yard."
410,207,Speeding in side street 50km/h zone,General,"Hitchcock st provides a shortcut between St Albans Rd and Fellmongers Rd. This shortcut is used by students of the Gordon Tafe and people travelling home in the afternoons as a way of avoiding the fellmongers rd and boundary rd round about which gets extremely congested from 3:30pm - 5:30pm weekdays. All day, every day people speed down this street. There are lots of families with young children in the street, it’s only a matter of time before the inevitable happens. I have been in the street 3 years and already I’ve seen 4 cars lose control on the corner halfway down Hitchcock st, 3 of which ended up in someone’s front yard."
411,208,Road surface,General,"The road has not been touched in the past 14 years, except for pothole filling. This road also has a causeway which floods with any moderate rainfall."
412,209,"Intersection of Flowers Dr and Pacific Hwy, Catherine a Hill Bay",General,"For 2 decades I've lived here and seen our Progress Assoc do everything it can to see this intersection improved. Surveys, guest speakers - Councillors, research consultants, MPs. Nothing. Accidents continue. They all seem to just wait for a developer to pay. At least put 1 Speed Camera Ahead sign north of the intersection. Over the time my son was born and is now driving to uni every day, not quite awake, rushing to get a park there. I live in dread."
413,21,Blocked storm water drain,General,The storm water drain has been blocked for over three years now. Every time it rains 1/3 of the street floods in that area causing a major risk to passing traffic. This is even more of a safety concern as it is right beside a child care centre. The drain is in front of 56 Camden street
414,210,"Problems with Gertrude Street, North Gosford",General,"Pot holes, crumbling road surfaces, lack of proper K&G, never-ending littering, speeding in a high density housing area (increasingly so, with the influx of low rental accommodation in the area), motorists ""dodging"" police presence in Mann Street and Henry Parry Drive, when moving between ""watering holes"" in CBD & Wyoming & illegal parking , and neither GCC, nor Police, seem concerned. All of this, between 2 T-intersections, one each side of an almost ""blind"" crest, makes one wonder that both authorities, will, seemingly, only finally respond when the inevitable fatality, or serious accident occurs. Past representations to GCC to install some form of traffic taming device in the most dangerous section of the street, between Ormond & Etna Streets, met with virtual ridicule, I'm sorry to say."
415,211,Mr greg clarke,General,This road floods in real heavy rain .It all ways floods into my property and neighbouring ones even though they put new drains there last year .The houseing commsion took them to court to fix it .It is on the corner of Northcott and maple circle Watanobbi.
416,213,Inadequate foot paths and speeding drivers,General,"This area of River Road is used heavily by walkers, push bike riders and families with young children on bikes and in prams. It is also a stretch of road that is used as a race track by a number of drivers, often reaching speeds of what seem like 100km an hour, with no respect of children riding their bikes or women pushing prams. My friend was pushing her baby daughter in a pram and was swerved at by a P plate driver who yelled out of the window to get off the road. It's very dangerous behaviour and I'm afraid of it ending in tragedy one day. There is a go slow section which is only treated as a race track by these crazy drivers, it's useless. A better solution is desperately required."
417,215,Dangerous Intersection,General,There have been multiple accidents at this intersection. There is at least one accident a week but I believe it would be more likely to be 3 or 4 a week. The road needs to be swept daily for glass from the accidents and it is causing residents flat tyres. This needs to be fixed before there is a major accident.
418,218,Nathan Rogers Test Subject,General,Nathan Rogers Test Details
419,219,Unsafe Road,General,Tregeagle Road is constantly full of potholes which occur every time it rains and are only filled with rubble that washes away at the first sprinkle. Also large trucks and double B's drive along this road and cause havoc as they drive in the middle of the road which is has too many unsafe corners. How about some lines down the middle of the road or at least fix the pot holes permanently.
420,22,Raised bision impaired pedestrian tile,General,Lifting tile creating trip hazard
421,220,Bumpy and uneven road surface,General,Brooms Head Road up the hill from River Street is bumpy and uneven causing people to take very strang lines up the hill. On occasions drivers have slowed so much that others have attempted to overtake only to have the slower vehicle change direction and speed up as they pass teh rough section. A resurfacing would make this a more predictable place to drive.
422,221,Wapengo Lake RD,General,"Drainage problems continue to make road impassible after less than 1"" of rain. The first hundred metres of the road needs drainage to prevent the existing 30cm deep rut across the road reoccurring. Also further along the road up to the culvert all the drains are blocked so when it rains the water backs up right across the width of the road at the drains."
423,222,Traffic Lights,General,"No sensitive sensors for motorcycles, will be sitting there till a car comes"
424,223,Lack of rain water drainage,General,Lack of rainwater drainage from the hill and roadways causing flash flooding during rain events.
425,224,"Speed signs, No speed Humps, and no paved sidewalks",General,"There is no pavements on the side walks, and people especially young children walk in the middle of the road. There are no speed limits on the main roads or the adjacent streets, and cars just speed up especially in Trevor Housley Avenue where there is no way to go. Some people dump rubbish as well and if it is a windy day we all get the rubbish in our lawns."
426,225,"A very ""bouncy Cessnock Rd",General,"Between Maitland and Cliftleigh, the road is so badly surfaced it is nearly impossible to keep the car on the road, extra traffic to the New Hunter Expressway has exacerbated an already broken down surface, ruts, crippled edges, potholes and uneven tar , only a matter of time before a speeding vehicle causes a head on because a rut threw the car to the wrong side."
427,226,Share bus and left only lane,General,"I am not sure if this is a Council issue or Road & Traffic issue. Hopefully Council can help either way. Old South Head Rd between Penkivil Street and Flood Street had a bus only lane, leaving only one lane for cars, motorbikes etc going into Bondi Junction. Why can the bus lane not become a shared lane between buses and left only turning cars (into Flood Street)? There aren't large numbers of buses at any time of day, so this strip becomes congested as vehicles trying to merge into an already full lane and the bus lane reminds mostly empty. It is so frustrating and dangerous."
428,227,Lines on road,General,"There seems to be a problem with the lane markings on the road on Curlewis Street near the intersection with Old South Head Rd. There is a left turning lane, middle lane which can go up to Birriga Rd or straight to O'Sullivan Re, and a right turn into Old South Head Rd. The problem somehow occurs when cars are trying to 'locate' the middle lane when they are in the vicinity of the beautician's shop. Somehow the marking is deceiving and people often find themselves in the wrong lane, which then causes a problem when they try to rectify their mistake. They tend to land up in the right turning lane instead of the middle one :( it used to work okay, but a couple of years ago, the lines were redrawn perhaps after road works (not sure) and this has led to this constant problem."
429,228,Left only lane,General,"There are two lanes in Penkivil Street joining with Old South Head Rd. I have seen so many near misses, due to cars in Penkivil street turning right from both lanes in (into OSHRd). Currently cars use the outside lane to turn left, go straight or turn right. The inside lane turns right. Could this spot be looked at, and arrows painted to have the outside lane turn left and straight only (not allow right turn), the inside lane remains right only."
430,229,Daily Congestion,General,"Congestion all day, as the only thorough fair thru town"
431,23,Street light not working,General,Light not on
432,230,Street light out,General,"Street light is out outside 27 Ripple Crescent, The Ponds"
433,231,"Open this fire trail, as an extension of Bundanoon Rd Woronora Heights",General,"This easement was closed in 2006 by rezoning it to 7A environment protected by order of Frank Sartor, Planning Minister. This was contrary to the advice of his planning team. It was hoped to get the road opened as originally determined in the Land an Environment Court in 1982, however strong opposition mainly from people in the Valley supported by the then Labor state MP Alison Magerrity persuade Frank Sartor to act on his own. Closure of this road causes the 3000+ residents of Woronora Heights to travel over 2000 kms annually to get in and out of their suburb. Moreover it has stopped the bus company to provide the residents of Woronora Heights and Valley a decent peak period bus service direct to Sutherland station which would reduce daily travel times for many by up to 40 minutes. Consequently many of these residents travel to work by car or drive to and park close by Sutherland station adding to the unnecessary and considerable parking congestion there. There have been many reports prepared over the past 25 years on this issue and in favour of opening this road and they should now be re-considered. There are dis-benefits to some peoples' life style as with all road projects but the overwhelming benefits to the overall community should be taken into consideration rather than to pandering the vocal minority to get more votes at elections State or Shire."
434,232,No road markings,General,"The intersections of Burns Road, Cleveland Street and Grosvenor Street in Wahroonga are not marked appropriately. The priority road goes from Cleveland through to Grosevenor with the two Burns Road intersections having Stop signs. However the council refuses to put line markings on this strange road layout. Thus people proceeding along Cleveland Street from Wahroonga turn turn across traffic from Grosvenor as they believe they have right of way - yet Burns road has a stop sign (ie it is the secondary road). Local drivers adopt the practise of stopping at the junction with Burns road and pretend there is a give way sign. The council should either mark the road with white lines to show the correct priority flow or put in a roundabout. The council has marked the roads approaching this interchange with white lines and has put in a new roundabout at Stuart Street but refuses to sort out this bizarre piece of road. Sooner or later there will be a nasty accidence."
435,233,Frame drive bridge,General,"Council changed limit on the bridge and to reinforce this they placed concrete barriers on either side to limit the size of vehicle that can past. The bus on its usual route scraped either side of the bus trying to fit though. The flow of traffic has slowed enormously. With frustrated drivers. One witnessed jumping the queue by three cars in front of him. Lights have now been added, only slowing traffic even more. The council also added more dirt and compacted it in the river bed. This was to allow the local school children to walk or ride through the river bed to get to and from school. This is an accident waiting to happen. Cessnock council has just made a huge problem out of a minor one."
436,234,Animal & people abuse,General,"Even though we have a lot of animals & they're a lot of people who take it in their hands try to get of them without council approval & believe some were slaughtered on our property even if we have a disability, it's believed they like hurting even if we get rid of the animals we're still targets for abuse we've told the police & the rspca & they've done nothing at all as if they're supporting it. the council should take authority over the rspca because we also believe that there are other people who may have a lot of animals & may or may not have a disability & don't have a farm are left alone & may have friends to help to either steal or slaughter other pets so no-one will know. We also have neighbour who suffers from strokes, drives a car, starts gossiping about things & watches porn videos & even if the neighbours knows about it, they do nothing about it as they're friends with him & they're others like us are copping similar problems to us. Also you should look into how some companies who are providing mobility equipment to the disabled as they maybe faulty and if the disabled want to put themselves way in credit to buy expensive equipment the company seems to think they've got the right to stop them from over crediting without asking the person in question first before doing it."
437,235,Hart Road Expressway exit,General,"Due to increased traffic at the intersection of Hart Road, Sawyers Gully Road and Gingers Lane, we have seen many accidents occur since the opening of the expressway, it is only a matter of time till we see a major accident happen. Due to increase traffic and poor visibility of traffic coming around the bends. A roundabout would help the flow of traffic and help avoid future accidents."
438,236,Broken/Missing grates over drain,General,There are several missing/broken grates in the drain along the pathway.
439,237,Pothole at traffic light,General,Pothole right on traffic light line. In Westbound queue second lane turning left
440,238,Pothole,General,"Pothole approaching the nelson rd edwards rd intersection, southbound"
441,239,Pothole,General,"Heading west on ryde road to turn right onto talavera in the left lane, pothole is located as you cross traffic at that intersection"
442,24,Pot hole,General,Fix pot hole test
443,240,Corner of Parry Street and Riviera Avenue,General,"The corner out of Parry Street, turning right into Riviera Ave can be hazardous when other traffic is nearby. Secondly, Council has recently ungraded half! of Parry St., but the remainder remains without a footpath, etc.. This is potentially dangerous for pedestrians, including young school children, who have to walk on a potholed and battered road that is frequently used by cars and trucks."
444,242,Damaged road surface.,General,Follow the removal of a tree outside of 4 Webbs Avenue Ashfield the road surface was left in a damaged state. This has been like this for at leased 6 months. Can you please repair.
445,243,Pothole,General,Heading west on the comenarra turning left onto wood street. Located at that intersection.
446,244,Pothole,General,"Numerous pot holes all the way down Nelson Rd from McHales way on both sides. In addition, Turning left from Nelson rd onto edwards rd potholes just at the lefthand bend"
447,245,Road dangerous,General,"On boundary rd, Between old pitt town rd and Hessian rd the road is quite narrow and the edges crumbling away with a lot of unevenness, it feels dangerous to drive along here especially at night"
448,246,Swings,General,The problem is located at The Holt Community Park. It is in the Children's play area. The ground underneath the swing needs to be built up so little kids can climb onto the swing.
449,247,Path edgeing,General,The problem is located at The Holt community Park. Grass is growing across the circular path. The path needs to be trimmed with an edger.
450,248,Road,General,England ave has pot holes in maybe 4 spots and large also there is very poor lighting in the street at night
451,249,Broken Surface,General,The surface of Tasman Close from about half way up the street to the end has broken up and exposed many areas of the base as well as the sublayer. The street needs to be resurfaced.
452,25,Street lights,General,The lights need a shroud so that I can get to sleep please.
453,250,Buchanan Rd Rebuild,General,This road has been neglected for years and now that it takes more traffic because of its connection to the Hunter Expressway it is much worse and nothing is being done to improve it
454,251,"Narrow, winding road with crumbling edges",General,"George Downes Drive at Kulnura is a narrow tourist road on route between Sydney and the Hunter Valley. It is a popular road frequented by cars, trucks, bicycles and cars. Council and State Government have been asked to upgrade the road as there have been accidents and deaths. The response is that now they are going to lower the speed limit. Speed has not always been the cause of these accidents, avoiding potholes has been a factor. Fix the road don't reduce the speed to 80km and 60km on this country road."
455,252,"""the roundabout of death""",General,"""The roundabout of death"" needs to go. This roundabout under Homebush bay drive, joining Underwood Rd and Australia Ave is deadly, mainly because of the people who use it and don't know how to use roundabouts or care about others' road safety. This intersection really needs a set of traffic lights."
456,253,Repair works needed,General,When it rains heavily the corner of Cleveland St and Anzac Parade floods. This makes it difficult for cars to be driven safely and impedes traffic flow.
457,254,Repairs needed,General,During heavy rain the street floods and water seeps into the business on the corner. Does not appear that stormwater drainage is adequate.
458,255,Tonga Park,General,Tonga Park has been reported by community members to have very poor lighting at night. It is believed that walking through this park is very dangerous at night as people under the influence seem to be in this dimly light park.
459,256,Missing painted arrows,General,"There are two lanes where a car can turn left or right out of Gloucester street bonnyrigg heights onto Cowpasture Road. However, there are no painted arrows on the road to indicate which lane is right turn only or left hand only. As such there is often a number of cases where cars have had near misses or there has been a bit of road rage. If arrows could be painted onto the road that would be appreciated."
460,257,Potholes,General,"There are numerous potholes, but 2 significant ones on the east entry to Fir Cres. Albion Park Rail. They have been there since the last major rainfall around 3 months ago."
461,258,Disgusting road,General,"Pot holes, uneven grading,unfinished work,Heavy Loaded Trucks using rd on daily basis"
462,259,Chain Valley Bay Rd.,General,"Poor surface, too narrow with bad shoulders as road is continually patched making it dangerous with an ever increasing traffic flow as more residences are occupied in the area. The intersection of this road with the Pacific Hwy. is also increasingly dangerous & badly needs Traffic Lights."
463,263,Missing Telstra pit lid,Footpaths,Lid is missing / cracked on traffic island. Hazard to traffic and pedestrians
464,264,Damaged road surface,General,"There is an enormous squashed-in hole. Quite a while ago the road was re-tarred then sprinkled with gravel, leaving it quite soft and sticky, and the next time the garbage truck collected the bins the weight of the vehicle stopped in that spot gouged the big hole into the road."
465,265,Lakes way rainbow flat,General,Appalling damaged road surface on a serious corner
466,266,Road needs resurfacing and 2nd footpath needs to be established,General,The potholes in the road get only patched up and after a week or so they are back again.
467,267,Condition of road,General,When you turn right from Warringah Road into Beacon Hill Road you merge into just one lane because of parked cars in the inside lane. When is something going to be done to widen Beacon Hill Road as these parked cars are a nuisance and what is more I am FED UP with our roads being used as a garage!
468,268,Condition of Deasys Rd Rothbury,General,The east end of Deasys's Rd is in very poor condition and has been for a number of years. It is full of pot holes and the edges of the road are giving way and are all over the place. (Warping). The north end of McDonalds Rd Rothbury is also in need of repair. One section has sunk while another section on the bend is full of potholes.
469,269,Exposed cable on power pole,General,There is a power pole in front of number 35 when an exposed cable. There is a cover over the cable that has been damaged and left the cable exposed at around waist hight.
470,27,Pot hole,General,Since the rain just before the flood a couple of weeks ago a pot hole has developed at the intersection of Deighton Rd and Gladstone Rd - lots of gravel coming away from it and cars' tyres spinning on it.
471,270,Tunnel not working,General,Having trouble accessing the tunnel. When is it supposed to be accessable
472,271,Pothole,General,Left hand lane
473,272,Street needing resurfacing,General,The Street has big holes around the gutters and extremely loose gravel. The street needs resurfacing and probably a street sweeper giving it a good clean. This may help with the loose gravel.

480,279,ACT Government car park,General,"Unsealed dirt parking, uneven surface with numerous bumps and large potholes (one immediately at carpark entry), soil erosion and boggy when wet."
481,28,Gas leak,General,"In the street outside the property line of 34 Auburn Ave. Due to the system of ""private gas providers"" reports normally go via the householder to their retail provider. But this leak is on the street, somewhere - it is smelled by passers by and NOT by the householder. We have been unable to find out which agency is responsible for the gas lines in the street"
482,280,Blocked lane,General,At intersection of Vale and miller Street cars can turn right into Vale Street and park in the left hand lane.

489,287,Pedestrians crossing inappropriatly,Road Signs,There are signs telling pedestrians to cross at the lights on the western corner of Cowper St ( opposite the Mantra) & also on the eastern side of Valentine steer facing toward Cowper St. Since the opening of the new Atria apartment building there has been a significant increase in the number of pedestrians crossing from Cowper St to Valentine st. This creating safety issues when drivers are trying to turn right out of Cowper into Parkes St which is difficult enough as it is. I know a sign won't stop this problem but might alleviate it. Also there is a problem with the signage for parking outside 33-35 Cowper St driveway leading to people parking across said driveway.as the sign does not indicate parking is not allowed across the driveway.
490,288,Car Park issue,General,"Large pot holes, uneven surface, holes are getting bigger."

496,294,Potholes,General,This section of Wallalong Crescent has deteriorated badly and is strewn with potholes and corrugation making the driving unsafe at times.
497,295,Road Surface,General,"Redbill Drive from Lawson Ave to Woodberry Road needs to be completely torn up and redone. Every time it rains, council come around to fill the holes only to be emptied again the next time it rains. The road surface is irregular, in fact, from about Eagle Close to Lawson Ave, you have to drive on the opposite side of the road to avoid the mole hills. The end of Redbill Drive at Woodberry Road is like swiss cheese."
498,297,More than ten pot holes,General,"Blue Ridge Drive, White Rock is riddled with pot holes and when a vehicle coming in the opposite directions approaches you are forced to drive over multiple pot holes."

502,300,Confusing traffic flow at intersection,Road Signs,"It is unclear at the Ferndell st traffic lights whether the two lanes of traffic can turn right onto Clyde st. Typically the left lane turns left onto Rawson rd and right lane turns left to Clyde st., which is the safest flow of traffic. However as there are no road signs or arrow markings on road, there are cases of cars turning right onto Clyde st from the left hand lane, who then immediately want to turn right on Wellington. This catches drivers unawares, cuts across traffic and causes merging issues. I have seen and experienced multiple near miss accidents here, as the drivers in right lane do not except someone to be undertaking from the left and then have them immediately turn right. If there were clear arrows marking the direction of turning on ferndell st, this problem would be solved. With left hand traffic only allowed left, and right lane traffic only allowed right."
503,301,Turn left on red sign required.,General,When turning left from Eurobin Avenue onto Pittwater Road I think it would be appropriate to have a 'turn left on red' sign. There is very good vision to the right to judge oncoming traffic for at least 200m. And the light cycle is understandably quite long.
504,302,Long queue in left lane,Road Signs,Darcy road into cumberland highway has two lanes; the right lane for right turn only. The left lane is used by all other traffic. Creates very long queues and delays during the daytime. Very small traffic using the right lane.
505,303,"Bilgola Bends, (Barrenjoey Rd., Newport to Avalon NSW",General,"This is the major arterial road to the Northern Peninsular of the Northern Beaches of Sydney, containing; Bilgola, Avalon, Clareville, Whale Beach and Palm Beach.

507,306,Bumps developed in road on corner,General,"Road is bumpy making the corner unsafe, cars need to slow significantly to take the corner, more than usual. this makes cars following come dangerously close to the rear as they are not expecting the car to slow down as much to take the corner."
508,308,23 plus potholes,General,There are roughly 23 potholes along Turramurra Ave from the Pacific Highway to the intersection with Boomerang St. These have become bigger since the recent rain. I understand that council doesn't want to resurface this road as the area is earmarked for further development. However given the state of the road I believe some remediation to patch these holes should be made for the council ratepayers that live around and use this road.
509,309,Traffic lights required,General,We need Traffic lights into Glenmore Park at both Northern Road entry and exit points at both Glenmore Parkway and Bradley Street
510,31,Excessive speeding,General,Cars speed along this road 24 hours a day. Use of speed bumps similar to Clarkson would be very nice.

521,32,Street lights out,General,Street lights out in Clovelly Road - between Carrington and Brook Street
522,320,Crossing,General,Many school kids either alone or with their parents cross this every morning and afternoon. Cars continue to drive faster than the speed limit and dangerous for those crossing the street. A crossing would benefit many pedestrians and hopefully also decrease cars speed.
523,321,Pot holes and Brocken edges of carriageway?,General,"The street is a throw back to the 1950,s and carries a large volume of traffic,especially in peak hours,school hours.and an embarrassment outside of the entrance to Rooty Hill R.S.L."

525,325,Dangerous corner,General,This corner needs a right hand turn light when coming up Castle Street and turning into Pennant Street. That is the way I turn most often but probably needs one coming down Castle Street to turn to Pennant Street. At last Community Safety Precinct Meeting this corner reports the most accidents. It is time something was done.
526,326,Radius of curve,General,This corner has a decreasing radius when coming from The Coast Road. There was a fatality this year on this bend. The corner needs to be redesigned so it has a constant radius.
527,327,Pot hole,General,Large pot hole in the left hand lane heading north. Just at the end of the new curb and gutter next to the hardware store.

530,33,Road markings Clovelly Road,General,Intersection of Clovelly and Frenchmans Roads heading to the city. Clovelly Road needs a left turn and straight ahead arrow painted on the road in the left lane and a straight ahead arrow in the centre lane. Too many cars are going left from the centre lane ... as if there were 2 left turn lanes. And the bus needs to go straight ahead from the bus stop. It's quite dangerous. Last week a car (or its driver) insisted on going left across the bus trying to go straight ahead.
531,330,Pothole,General,Recent pothole covered but opening up again
532,332,Pothole,Pothole,A pothole has developed right in the path of wheels
533,333,Road surface,General,The entire length of the bitumen section is patched to the point of being dangerously rough and uneven. Sections are comstantly falling away on the edges causing traffic to drive in the centre of the road. The gravel section has huge potholes and some corrugations. In places these also cause traffic to take evasive acrion and drive on the wrong side of the road.
534,334,Pothole on the road,General,There is a big pothole which is a hazard to all vehicles travelling from Doonside road (approaching from the Grt Western hwy) towards Bungaribee road Please fix ASAP
535,335,Graffiti on footpath,General,"The footpath has recently been replaced on the corner outside 9 Gerald Crescent. About one week ago, someone has spray painted graffiti on the footpath."
536,336,Poor lighting which is dangerous to pedestrians,General,"The side driveway to my block of units has no light on the street, making it very dangerous at night time pulling into the driveway because you cannot see any pedestrians and parked cars on the street add to this difficulty. It is particularly a problem in Winter when children are still walking on the street after 5.30pm when it is dark"
537,337,Dangerous driving,General,"Guildford road is a haven for fast drivers, it is constantly barraged at night by street racers, causing immediate concern to the families that live in the area, whilst constant and busy during the day it is at night when all the illegal driving occurs, many times I have seen near misses, many times are people blocking the street, speed bumps are needed on this lengthy street to slow drivers down. There is a large family community in the area of an average of 3 children per family."
538,338,Graffiti on location post and road,General,As well as graffiti on both sides of the Great Western Highway Minchinbury (already reported) there is graffiti on the location post on the side of the road.
539,339,Fix our road,General,"The street we reside on is quite long 1100 meters with 5 speed hump & legally zoned as a 4 tonne load limit, with many large trucks & motorbikes using this street, potholes are a regular issue, not to mention the inadequate positioning & worn speed humps, FIX OUR STREET"
540,34,Excessive stones on road,General,Stones have been washed onto the road surface after the recent continuous rain.
541,340,Rubbish dumped,General,"This spot is regularly used as a dumping ground due to it not being in front of a house - its next to the basketball court - Beds, TV, furniture, mattresses etc - Its a real eyesore. If the verge was landscaped with small trees or bushes as per Blair Street then it would deter dumpers"
542,342,Speed Signs on the Good Hope Rd,General,"The speed limit on the Good Hope Road is 80 kms per hour. It is a dangerous road, narrow, bad surface and terrible edges and it carries local traffic and water ski boats and fishing boats. There are currently only two signs on the 11 kms of road, one from either direction and both have been defaced by grafitti. Most of the drivers drive at 100kms or greater. They either do not see the signs or choose to ignore them because they are small."
543,343,Pothole,General,Pothole out on road adjacent to driveway. We have to swerve or straddle pothole to avoid damaging tyres which increases chance of accident w on coming vehicles as there is a 100km sign approx 100m before.
544,345,Collapsed culvert 157 Docker St,General,"Large depression in front of 157 Docker St Wagga causing severe axel thump on articulated vehicles. This sound rattles windows in adjacent homes. Road surface is showing signs of collapse and associated horizontal cracking. The depression has become worse over time indicating a collapsed structure below the road surface, most likely a cross drainage structure. If not fixed soon it will be come a safety problem that will expose council to malfeasance."
545,346,Speeding danger - urgent,General,Sunset Boulevarde is situated on a steep hill and motorists use the street as a short cut to Newcastle University. Students are often running late and speed down this street quite recklessly and at very high speeds although it is designated as a 50 zone. I suggest a couple of speed similar to those in Janet street bumps be installed in order to slow things down before a serious accident occurs
546,347,"Nimala Avenue, Koolewong",General,"This road is a disgrace it urgently needs attention. It is too narrow, has numerous potholes and broken pavement. Is difficult to turn around due to parked cars, caravans etc in the turning circle, & to access the private ramp to house numbers 29, 31, 33. We are trying to sell land @ 29 and interested parties are appalled at the state of the road. When will it get attention?"
547,348,Goat track called a road,General,"The bucketts way between taree and Gloucester is a disgrace for a main road nothing has been done for a long time to fix this road. this is a school bus route, you cannot hear youself because of the condition of road."
548,349,Speeding Drivers,General,Cars constantly go faster then 50kms/hr. There should be speed humps to slow them down ... particularly as there is a school at the end of the street.
549,35,Hole in nature strip & graffiti,General,"Hi, there is a small but deepish hole dug out in the grass/nature strip near the electric pole outside number 19 Blackshaws road Newport (on the side/south of the road near curb). Myself (carrying my baby) and my 4yr old have twisted our ankles getting in and out of our car a couple of times as its right where you need to stand to get in and/or adjust kids carseat etc. if it could be filled in that would be great? Also the electrical pole next to it has black graffiti on it too, would be good if this could be removed? Thanks."
550,350,Dangerous intersection,General,"There should be a roundabout on the corner of Childs st and John St Lidcombe. When turning right from Childs st into John st, visibility is very poor due to parked cars in John st. A roundabout here would go a long way towards resolving the problem."
551,351,"No footpath, No Drainage. Have to walk on Road with Kids",General,"Hi, There is no footpath on either side in between No 15 and No 1, New Farm Rd. After it has rained we have to walk on road the as there is no drainage aswell. Whilst walking my son in stroller I have nearly been hit 3 times. Also card are parked on the side of road which means we have to walk around them ending up int he middle of the road. Also after it has rained as there is no footpath and only grass is get very slippery and hence we are forced to walk on the road"
552,352,Illegally Parked Vehicles,General,I have given up trying to catch the bus here due to the Bus Stop being parked out by illegally parked vehicles. They park on the nature strip and on the footpath also. The nature strip is now dirt. Can something be done to put a proper kerb stone in to stop vehicles mounting the footpath and using it as a parking station.
553,353,Potholes,General,"Berringer Way, Flinders 2529 has numerous potholes from Baragoot Road to Urana Way. Shellharbour Councils pot hole crew simply fill the holes, tamp the hot mix down and depart. Alas they are back within a few months to do the same thing again. If these potholes were fixed right the first time Council would save many dollars and most of the rate payers would be happy as damage to their cars caused by pot holes would be greatly minimised."
554,354,Stupid Signage,Road Signs,"There is a new ""Safety Camera"" on Victoria Road. The speed limit on Victoria Road is 70. First problem is that just before the Safety Camera sign, there is a sign indicating the speed limit changes from 50 to ? but the Safety Camera sign is showing 50. Secondly, there are so many signs that they tend to hide each other as well as the traffic lights at the intersection."
555,355,"Road degradation Bay St, Hat Head NSW 2440",General,"This stretch of road has been in extremely poor condition for many years & is a patchwork quilt of temporary repairs. Heavy vehicle traffic has caused degradation of the road surface to the point where there is no water run-off. Large potholes (the one pictured is almost a metre across & 20cm deep) keep reforming as patching is ineffective. Being a tourist destination, there is an increase in activity in warmer months & the road is a severe hazard to traffic as well as to the many children frequenting the area & riding bicycles. Over the years, I have observed (& gone to the aid of) several cyclists who have suffered injuries as a direct result of the condition of the road surface."
556,356,Ascot Road surface,General,The road surface in Ascot Road between Mona St and Purcell St is in need of permanent resurfacing rather the temporary filling of potholes and other imperfections with the bitumen mixture that is currently used. This section of road is one of the most used streets in Bowral and should be maintained in good condition rather than the humps and bumps that currently exist.
557,357,Massive Potholes,General,"Two massive Potholes, whenever it rains they get even bigger. They haven't been fixed in years. They are that big that you can't even drove through them anymore, the oncoming car has to wait to pass."

559,359,Jibbon Street Cronulla,General,"As one of South Cronulla's busiest street, Jibbon street needs to be re-surfaced (bitumen) as there are several potholes in this short stretch of road. I suspect the council plan on doing this soon but just in case have nominated it."
560,36,"Rubbish, glass & graffiti",General,"Hi, there is glass, rubbish and ugly graffiti along the road in the grassy area (particularily on east side of road) on the side walls and under the underpass. As there is no concrete path on that side if we approach walking from the south east with my kids and I (with buggy) have to walk along the grass. I always worry my 4yr feet in his sandals will get scratched or cut with the glass or a buggy tire punctured. Would be good if it could be cleaned up."
561,361,Degradation and pot holes,General,Large pot holes and degradation on left side of street as you come up from Elizabeth Bay Drive.
562,362,Waitovu Street Mosman,General,"The buses have created a huge pothole at the corner of Mandolong Road. The Council fixes it every few years, but the hot mix fix they use is hopeless and a new pothole forms in a few months."
563,363,Please fix my street,General,"Both ends of Dunlop Road are in need of repair. cnr of Dunlop and Alistair Ave, Forresters beach especially needs attendion, with loose and exposed rocks."
564,364,Whisky Creek Road,General,"The entire length of Whisky Creek Road, Dorrigo, need re-surfacing. The worst section is in front of 335 Whisky Creek Road."

567,367,Road needs resurfacing.,General,"Surface is breaking up, weeds growing through & pot holes developing."
568,368,Speeding drivers and riders,General,"Many drivers and motorbike riders use Cooper St, Penrith as a speedway. It is marked as 50 kph but that is rarely observed. With cars parked on the side of the road it is difficult to reverse out of driveways and with excessive speeding - an accident waiting to happen."
569,369,Dangerous Intersection,General,"The intersection of Cooper St and Northern Road has already seen multiple accidents. With all the extra traffic from Jordan Springs and the road works on Northern Road, trying to turn right into Cooper St and especially turning right out of Cooper St south bound is a nightmare. Visibility is poor, drivers speeding and weaving in traffic. Russian Roulette is safer."
570,37,Road surface,General,Road surface is wearing away due to truck movements
571,370,Offensive Graffiti,General,"A large, white Swastika was spray-painted on intersection of Leura Mall and Malvern Street, Leura, during the night of the 11th/12th September. It is not the first occurrence of such graffiti in this particular occasion; such graffiti has been seen and noted in the past. A report of such was made verbally to Katoomba Police Station on the morning of the 12th."
572,371,Crossing,General,We would like to have crossing as school there and there is over 100 kids cross that road in everyday. Kids most of the time been told off sworn by motorist.
573,372,Dangerous traffic calming circle at intersection,General,"I find this part of the road to be quite dangerous and have hit the traffic calming circle during night driving, after turning right from Wollongong Road to proceed to the traffic lights at Wolli Creek rd and Forest Rd. It's caused by a dip in the t-section break on the eastern side of the intersection on Wolli Creek Rd, in the direction for cars travelling west and east-bound, combined with a broken lane divider barrier at the junction of the intersection in this area to direct traffic between the lanes operating east. Cars trying to turn right coming from a southerly direction on Wollongong Rd gave the stop sign and a pedestrian crossing to deal with just before the intersection. I have found on many occasions that quite a few cars that are travelling west on Wolli Creek Rd, after coming through the lights, slow down thinking they need to give way to the drivers waiting to right turn into Wolli Creek rd from Wollongong Rd, travelling north. Consequently, traffic banked up travelling east to the left of this intersection then rushes through to catch the lights, and anyone who misjudges the central traffic calmer can run straight over/into it, while trying to change lanes anticipating the right hand lane turn light remaining green. I suggest that a chicane-style traffic calmer barrier be placed here for cars travelling west on Wolli creek Rd, or alternatively a small roundabout to regulate smoother flow of traffic. Consequent slower light changes for the traffic signals going straight through in an east direction (this is currently the left lane of the road only) at the intersection of Wolli Creek rd and Forest Rd would regulate traffic bank-up in this section better than drivers can manage manually with the current arrangements now. I am happy to discuss this idea with road engineers and town planners at Rockdale Council if required. Refer to Feb 2014 map position for specific visual details: https://www.google.com.au/ maps/ place/ Wolli+Creek+Rd,+Sydney+NSW/ @-33.9416877,151.132052,3a,75y,90h,90t/ data=!3m4!1e1!3m2!1s8EozO4KJOBrzqP1_7_l7XA!2e0!4m2!3m1!1s0x6b12ba05c41af325:0xb74b4f58a65a3354"
574,373,Graffiti,General,Along most walls and is never cleaned off.
575,374,Access,General,"Entry and exit from Hillsborough is very difficult at peak hour more so since Cardiff entry has been improved. When the dog shows are on some drivers come on to the wrong side of the road , into the merge lane to go to the showground and 2 cars turn at once blocking exit from Chadwick(Moody) Street."
576,375,Outback in Suburbia,General,Street is 50M from houses in 5 acre subdivision.
577,376,Roundabout needs a reflective signage,General,"This roundabout has a large tree in the centre of it. When entering the roundabout heading north-west along Hyam St, there is no reflective sign at the roundabout. At night time there is not a lot of street lighting and with no reflective signage I feel this is dangerous, especially as there is a tree in the middle of the roundabout. It would be great for the reflective signage to be replaced. Thank you"
578,377,Speed limit and more speed humps and pedestrian footpath.,General,"Increase in both vehicle and pedestrian traffic with the new medical centre opening, Aldi, RTA and shopping centre all along this lane as well as the RSL club. This Lane has become dangerous."

584,382,Intersection needs resurfacing,General,"The intersection of Gardeners Rd and Bourke Rd is in dire need of resurfacing, being full of gouges, splits and cracks in its bitumen surface over concrete base, with numerous gaps up to 8cm deep. Every crossing of Gardeners Rd is a bone shuddering experience."
585,383,Poor concrete surface,General,"Beamish St, from Canterbury Rd to Shelley St, is made up of unsurfaced concrete blocks. These have changed height over time, with the result there is a generally 5cm gap between each of them. There is a small amount of patching but it is old and given the significant gaps, is of negligible benefit."
586,384,Road needs resurfacing,General,Outside number 22 and 24...road closest to gutter very poor condition...
587,386,Road Surface Deterioration of Amazon Rd Seven Hills,General,The road surface of Amazon Rd has broken down due to a lack of spray seal adhesion. The shedding of aggregate has become both a hazard to motorists and pedestrians.
588,387,Excessivly bright street light,General,"Recently the bulb in the street light outside of numbers 58 and 60 Frenchs Forrest road adjacent to the bus stop was replaced with a much higher intensity orange coloured bulb. As a result the nearby house are now brightly illuminated at night. Despite installing new heavier curtains in the affected rooms our young children still have trouble sleeping, often mistaking the orange glow coming in for sunrise. Our neighbours have also expressed their concerns about the new much brighter streetlight. We would like to see the light bulb replaced a lower intensity, white colour bulb similar to others in the area."
589,388,Street light not working,General,"Street light has been out for over 6 months, sometimes it comes on for a little while then it turns off. That corner in particular is very dangerous as cars tend to travel either too fast or cross onto the wrong side. Needs urgent attention before there is an accident. Thanks Andrew"

597,395,Pedestrian Crossing,General,Pedestrians cross Norton St here whenever they want (ignoring the cross in groups instruction)often backing up traffic back to Pioneer's Park.

599,397,Road surface coming away from gutter.,General,I rang up months ago asking if they can resurface the guttering as the road is wearing away and weeds grow through. I have a sore back and it's too hard to pull them out. If you drive around Warragamba it's common.
600,398,Bumpy Road,General,"When travelling east along Tudor St, Hamilton and you turn right into Steel St, the bumps and undulations in the road are very bad. The car jumps around and I have no doubt a car would lose control in wet weather if they turned into Steel St a bit too fast. I challenge anyone to take that turn and say it's OK as it is."
601,399,Pedestrian Crossing dangerous,General,"The pedestrian crossing outside 333 Glebe Rd, Merewether is very dangerous. My wife (whilst waiting on Henry St to turn into Glebe Rd) has witnessed many near misses where vehicles have sailed through the crossing (travelling west) when pedestrians are half-way across. Even our 14yr old son came home one day telling us he almost gone run over whilst crossing there. Part of the problem appears to be that drivers, whilst heading west, are allowing their vehicles to speed up (over the speed limit) as they come down the hill on the approach to the crossing. It's very dangerous and it will probably only be a matter of time before someone gets injured or killed there."
602,40,Pothole,General,Pothole just before pedestrian crossing speed hump.
603,400,Bumpy Road turning into Chatham St Hamilton South,General,"When turning into Chatham St, Hamilton South, from Glebe Rd, the road is very bumpy and should really be fixed.

605,402,Raised Concrete,General,7 Hamersley Place Fisher
606,403,Death trap,General,Trucks or cars with long caravans leaving caltex servo and entering the highway completely block access to midge st. If you are coming from north and a long vehicle is waiting to enter the highway you are stuck in limbo on the highway. There is no turning lane so you just wait and hope nothing hits you from behind.
607,404,Road needs resurfacing,General,"The end of my street has deteriorated into a gravel road full of potholes. I pay my council rates so basic services like decent roads can be looked after.

We have a black line alogn Metella road which is has an enven surface that looks ugly. The residents in Metella road deserve better than this. I hope that something can be done to correct htis soon, I look forward to Council consideration of this matter. The Residents fo Metella Road Toongabbie NSW thank you"

614,412,Disgraceful road,General,Just not maintained !
615,413,Crosswalks at Fiveways intersection,General,The crosswalks are located too close to roundabout intersection creating a hazard because driver attention is distracted to negotiating the round about conditions and traffic flow instead of more focus ahead on approaching crosswalk.
616,414,Dangerous parking,General,"Grace Avenue, from Prince Charles Ave. to Forestway Shopping Centre, the street is too narrow for parking on both sides of the road. Please can someone decide on parking on one side.

618,416,Dangerous intersection - bus lane collisions,General,"Frequent collisions occur during heavy traffic (some require all 3 emergency services attendance) when attempting to cross 3 north bound lanes to enter Turimetta Street. When 2 lanes of traffic leave a gap, it is the bus lane motorists doing the 70km speed limit who continue north and T-bone cars entering Turimetta St on a regular basis. Mona Vale Police Station is also located in Turimetta Street & police vehicles sounding sirens are unable to stop traffic in order to exit Turimetta St to attend an emergency. The speed limit only reduces to 60km after this intersection and continues into congested Mona Vale where roadside parking halts the centre lane causing more traffic gridlock. ""Crash Collision Area"" signage & paint work in a thatched pattern could help as could a reduced speed before Turimetta St."
619,417,Bad potholes at traffic lights,General,On the eastern side of this intersection there are a selection of very bad potholes that need to be fixed. Maybe you could check the rest of them - the other three sides.

636,434,Hole in footpath,General,"Three weeks ago I reported a large hole opened up in the footpath outside out house - the stormwater drain underneath has disintegrated and a dinner plate size hole opened up. VERY dangerous. Some council blokes put some witches hats over it but it is STILL there. There is a similar hole also down the street, same block."

645,442,Four wheel drive vehicle,General,"Friday afternoon walking dog in manning park, I noticed a 4 wheel drive exiting the road which leads into manning park. The car went up the hill, westerly direction into the bush area. This was making a huge noise and mess as the incline was steep. I followed him up there, he then came back over the hill towards me. I pulled out my mobile phone to take a photo but couldn't see properly, but did register his vehicle number. 1CPJ974 a dark blue 4 wheel drive. I stood my ground, he swerved around me and I said I would report this incident to the council, and he would possibly be fined. He then roared thru the bushland, drove off and turned into pagneil crt. 2 problems I believe have recently arisen. The main one is the fire break grader has opened up an access to the west of the main entry area to Manning Park, Cnr davilak and Janson road, therefore now allowing a new access to the bushland. I have noticed that vehicles are now accessing areas that have not been accessed for many years, which secondly is destroying the bushland. I would like a response please and will the person be fined for entering bushland via vehicle? Tel 0434936872. Robyn Colledge"
646,443,Speed hump or zebra crossing,General,There is a childrens park adjacent to this street. People speed well over the speed limit on Max Jacobs Avenue.

657,455,Unfinished pavement,General,PACKARD CL ingleburn NSW has been prepared for pavement but work stopped suddenly. Some sand were sprayed on the unfinished grounds and no more work has been finalized. Wonder what is the problem?
658,456,Dangerous problem with visibility,General,"There is a massive problem with visibility when turning right/left into sutherland road from Glenelg Place. There is currently a mirror being used to check cars coming down sutherland road. This mirror is now blocked by shrubs, hence the visibility is even poorer. Sutherland road is very uphill and downhill. There have been many accidents on this stretch of road because of this nature of sutherland road many motorists tend to speed. So together with speeding motorists and low visibility , someone turning onto sutherland road from Glenelg place , is at a significant risk. The other issue is when turning right into Glenelg Place, again oncoming cars can only be spotted whilst driving over the top of the previous hill on sutherland road. Glenelg place lies in a valley. Due to an overgrowth of trees along sutherland road the visibility from the top if the previous hill is also severly restricted. Therefore again turning into Glenelg Place is a very very dangerous situation, like I mentioned before cars coming down sutherland road tend to speed."
659,457,Need a road divider on corner,General,"Traffic coming out of Laurina Ave, usually turning right onto Porter Rd consistently cut the corner and sit on the right side of the road and make it impossible to turn right into Laurina. Dangerous. A road divider or cats eye in centre of road will force drivers to stay to the left and allow for a safer experience"
660,458,New Traffic Islands a Hindrance,General,"Last week, new concrete traffic islands were installed on the left side of Power street just before the intersection with Knox road. This means that traffic is forced into banking up in one lane instead of two. Whereas previously the traffic would bank up in two lanes up to about Crawford road, because of these traffic islands, the traffic is forced into banking up in one lane and banks up way back up the street to as far as Crawford Public School. This is made worse by the fact that the traffic light sequencing gives traffic in Power street heading west the shortest possible time to go so only 4-5 cars get to go through the green light before it changes again. This intersection is a nightmare of a morning and is also made worse by a dedicated right turn lane which is unnecessary as the majority of traffic goes straight ahead or turns left. The structure of this intersection, the traffic light sequencing and now the new traffic islands all work towards making this intersection a major traffic nightmare and council needs to rethink it completely!"
661,459,Road repair required,General,"In Stewart street, near the corner of Victoria street, the road was opened to repair a water leak. This was over 6 months ago and it has never been repaired."
662,46,Broken streetlight,General,"Streetlight near 9 Bourke Street, Riverstone not functioning correctly."
663,460,Speeding,General,"Since the Sexton Hill upgrade, Pioneer Parade has become much, much busier. This is exacerbated by the Banora primary school on Pioneer Parade. As our house is situated on a bend in the road, we constantly see cars speeding & cut the corner in front of our house. There are many children in this street that have to walk on the road to school as there are few footpaths. With the increased volume of traffic, a disaster is in the making!"
664,461,Pothole,General,"Upon moving over to turn left from Myrtle St, there a pothole which I've accidentally hit twice over the past few weeks. This needs to be fixed as its in a regular used by drivers. Has potential to cause wheel damage."

668,466,Willandra Road Street Parking,General,When turning right from Warringah Road into Willandra Road quite often you are unable to turn right due to the build up of traffic. This is all because we have 1 car parked in the left hand lane after the lights at McDonalds causing a lot of traffic during school pick up. Parking isn't allowed after 3:30 but feel it should be moved to 2:30 onwards as it causes so many problems.
669,467,Crevice in gravel road,General,"A crevice has been washed in the middle of the road and it deepens with each heavy rain. It is dangerous both for vehicles and pedestrians, particularly the 93 yr old woman who lives alone along this street. This has been reported to Council which has taken to action to repair."

674,471,Bellevue rd from double bay to bellevue hill,General,"The state of condition from fairfax rd intersection to rivers st intersecion is deplorable and has been for years the surface of the rd is very rough. I recently experienced open heart surgery and the journey down from Rivers st to Fairfax rd was excruciatingly painful due to the terrible surface of the rd. I have never complained about the state of the Road before as I have known about it for years, but due to the operation it became self evident that this stretch of rd, about 1 km is in desperate need of a resurface."
675,472,Large pothole/depression,General,"Mid-coast water advise me that the water hydrants were moved from the road some years ago to stop continual damage by traffic. The location they were moved from was not properly treated, so the road surface has dropped causing the problem. There has been a considerable increase in the volume and size of vehicular traffic over the past couple of years, and the noise of trucks hitting the pothole is deafening, particularly large empty trucks with trailers, and also,timber trucks . We feel the vibrations through our home. Council did a good job of stopping water from the road entering our property last year, and I thought they were/are aware of this problem, as water fills the hole and then is dispersed our way when traffic goes through it. The water is not a real problem,but the noise and vibrations are a huge worry. Our address is 25 Cowper Street; on Bucketts Way."

677,474,Dangerous lifting of surface anad uneven surface on railway bridge,General,"The road surface on the railway bridge has been an ongoing maintenance issue for a number of years and there was some major works done on it about 12 months ago. However, this work has now degraded to the point that you need to drop your speed to about 20kph to be safe, or you skid on the surface...it's badly damaged by heavy trucks. We travel this road twice a week and have seen the degradation. It needs urgent attention and concreting, not asphalt. This is a major road and should have major expenditure."

We need sum sort of speed humps or road slowing hills to stop this continuing . We are very close to local public school, nursing home & train station & there is no pedestrian crossing to enable safe crossing to help with the issue of speeding drivers & crossing. The police do not monitor this end of kings rd as they do the northern end frequently 4 drivers doing more than the 50km limit.

680,478,Dangerous One Lane Bridge,General,"The most absurd and dangerous piece of road I've ever encountered. Very little warning a one lane bridge is approaching, no advice on who has right of way, cannot see through the slats of the bridge to see if there is any oncoming traffic. People not familiar with the area speed up to this bridge and on several occasions I've had to reverse backwards into traffic to allow some bully car through that has not slowed to see if anyone is coming. At the very absolute minimum this bridge needs to be patrolled by a simple traffic light."

Whenever we have to walk through the area, I have to be on the road as there is no foot path on one side. The other side is a slope and hard to maniuvre my baby pram/stroller.

699,499,Inappropriate lanes,General,Approaching Parramatta Road from Bland Street both lanes have to dangerously merge into one going towards Haberfield. What should happen (on the Ashfield side) is the right lane should be right hand turn ONLY and this would avoid the merging problem.
700,50,Safety concerns with uneven gravel area,General,The red gravel area on the street side of the unit complex at 3 Peron Place Banks is washing away and there is a drop off the cement area near their letterboxes and there is concerns that it is dangerous and as it is not owned by the complex who is responsible should anyone be injured on that area?
701,500,Pacific Highway exit has destinations listed in the wrong order,General,"The sign suggests that Hornsby is accessed from the left most lane. This is incorrect. To access the lane for Hornsby, you must be in the middle lane (right lane of the exit)."
702,501,Speeding cars and bikes,General,My road - Blue Hills - needs speed humps or chicanes to stop the daily speeding idiots!
703,502,Traffic Signals moved by storm - not easily visible.,General,It is very difficult to see the red arrow on the traffic signals when turning left from Berowra Waters Road into the northbound Pacific Highway.
704,503,Lack of right hand turn bay at northbound give way,General,"The right-hand turn from Royston Parade to Ku-Ring-Gai Chase Road needs to give way to through traffic from Belmont to Royston (as well as all traffic from Ku-Ring-Gai Chase Road to Belmont Ave). In peak periods when there is a lot of traffic, it can take a very long time for a gap to appear to be able to complete this turn."
705,505,Faulty street light,General,Street light flickers and goes out continually. Has been like this for several months. First streetlight on right as you enter oxbow court

So when you cross it it feels and sounds like the front end or wheel rims are going to be or have been damaged. Doesn't matter if you are doing 50kph or 5kph it is that bad. We locals call it the tank trap.
715,516,Pot holes r us!,General,"Too many pot holes on this road. They've been covered by gravel (I think) but since it was so badly done, the rain has uncovered all of them again.

717,519,Street parking,General,Provide parking on one side of the road only because when two cars are parked facing opposite directions it becomes a race between opposing vehicles not to give way. This has happened too much. As a nrma patrol man this is a bad hazzard when rushing to un lock a car with a child inside.
718,52,Litter,General,"Piles of rotting litter have been building up in the gutters on the eastern side of Hopetoun St for more than a year and council does nothing about it. Broken glass, bottles and food containers."

723,525,Pedestrians crossing inappropriately,Laws and Enforcement,"Pedestrians cross against the red light, single people and flocks of students. The traffic is held up and I have observed numerous near misses. Something needs to be done to prevent an injury. Further to this cars turn left from the right lane on railway street entering Hawkesbury road because of the number of people crossing on the green light for cars. People become frustrated and try and get through the lights by going around on the right lane turning left"
724,526,Abandoned Motor Vehicle,General,"This car has been in the car park of the Yass Junction Station car park for weeks now, and its up on bricks, pot plants and whatever else they could find to remove its wheels"

727,531,Small Street Big Problems,General,"I live in Redbank Ct MARDI, this cul-de-sac has become dangerous to get in & out of with cars parked on the street, buses used as mobile homes and 1 tree thoughtlessly planted on the corner at number 11 blocking the view down the road as you enter. My family plus friends visiting and I have been forced up onto the gutter to get in or out of the street, I have had a blown tyre on one occasion and a scratch on my car because of this. I have requested council come out and trim back the tree on the nature strip before & it is in desperate need to be done again. The residents at number 11 don't seem to care because it is on the council strip."
728,532,Massive Dip,General,"At entry into round a bout heading East, the road has a dip in it that has been getting worse over the last few months. It's quite dangerous as it seriously disturbs the cars stability."

733,54,Poor signage,General,"On more than one occasion i have dropped people off at the airport and have tried to get back onto the freeway to Newcastle and ended up heading toward Woolongong. Coming out of the airport there is no signage to direct me north in any way shape or form. One sign gives me the option of City or M1. I don't want to go to the City. I want to go to the northern suburbs at least, if not directly to Newcastle but, as there is no signage for either I choose M1 because I know I have to get onto it to go north but I can't get the right direction. It takes me south so I have to go till I can turn around. There seems to be no roads north from the airport and I can't work that out as I just came from the north to get there."
734,540,Overgrown footpaths,General,The walkway from Kerrigan to Morrow street between 37 & 39 Morrow street is badly overgrown with grass. Also the footpath on Kerrigan Street about 75m north of the Kerrigan/Dunnett street roundabout is blocked with prunings thrown there from a house backing onto Kerrigan street.
735,541,Long Grass,General,"Long grass across street, attracting brown snakes in residential area. Please get someone to get rid of the long grass in the area"
736,542,Curb and guttering very high,General,"A) The pedestrian footpath in front of our premises was built ‘higher’ than our ‘driveway slab’ causing rain water to run into our premises and collect. b) Because of the above mentioned footpath design, the incline of our driveway is likely to be at 30 degrees which is more than twice the standard. c) Because of the above mentioned footpath design, our vehicles are getting damaged when entering and exiting the driveway. d) Because of the above mentioned footpath design, our concrete of our inclined driveway is breaking away. Also the grass area next to the inclined driveway has a steep incline causing the sandy soil to run into the gutters and into the drains. e) The extreme convex camber of the road on Ireton Street, at the intersection of Victoria Lane (south end) Malabar causes a alarming dip of the road at this intersection. Vehicle on a daily bases, even when travelling at a slow walking pace collide with the road causing vehicle debris on the road and damage in the bitumen. Some larger vehicle frequently get stuck on the road at this intersection and have to be towed from the road, blocking Ireton street at times."
737,543,Lack of Street Lighting,General,There is no street lights in this section of Eddy St. To make it safe at night street lights need to be installed.

741,547,Grass Hazard,General,"Hi. The local area of Forde is overgrown to the point that we are no longer able to use the open parks and walkways due to long grass, paspalem and obnoxious weeds. he open grassed areas particularly along the Forde ponds between Horse Park Drive through to Mulligans Flat are a disgrace. The cost of land rates and land tax in the area are not recipricated with keeping the concept of Forde as it should be, an open and park like environment that encourages people to move in and around the area. The place has gone to the dogs."
742,548,Bad corner no curb and gutter,General,The entrance to our street (from whiting ave) is a really bad corner. We have nearly had our parked car hit a few times. There is also no curb and gutter on either side at the start of the road and no paved/Asphelted parking for the park
743,549,Clearway needed in peak hours-Bingara Crescent,General,"There is increasing traffic using Bingara Crescent during peak hours - morning and afternoon - south bound between First Orchard Avenue and Seven Hills Road. There is only one lane for the majority of this space, and there are always parked cars in the left lane, so traffic banks up, as cars can't get into the left lane until the last minute to turn left onto Seven Hills Road. Traffic banks up the entire length of Bingara Crescent a lot of the time."

745,552,Dangerous corner,General,Cars turning right from Acacia rd into Burrogorand rd at Ruse continually cut the corner and nearly collide with cars coming out of Burrogorang rd that are turning left onto Acacia rd. I am nearly hit by another car here atleast twice a week and I speak to neighbors and other local people who expess the same concerns. It's only a matter of time before there is a crash here. A simple concrete strip with a keep left sign would solve this problem.

All residents need to eat up their act!
754,560,Port macquarie road bogee,General,"The access to resident's properties along Port Macquarie Road at Bogee 2489 has deteriorated due to lack of road grading on this road for well over two years.

758,564,Fix our Roads,General,Wilson drive Hill Top has taken enough lives especially young children. Quit the revenue raising by having the police there and do something to fix the road instead. It needs a lot of work and trees cleared so the residents can access their homes safely
759,566,Road traffic & Pedestrian Hazard,General,"East corner of Wharf St & Pacific St. Woolgoolga has vegetation growing down to road edge making it a blind corner for traffic & as footpath is completely overgrown ,pedestrians are forced onto roadway. Appeals to Coffs Council for over 7 years have brought absolutely no action, except owner will be told to trim bushes but still nothing happens. Appeal for at least a centre line on bend resulted in being told road too narrow. Beginning to suspect property in question owned or rented by council employee. Please can something be done before someone is killed. Errol Stevens.."
760,568,Unnecessary traffic,General,"Tourist traffic pour down our street during holiday times because they think they can get into Stocklands Nowra, they can't, but council ( at my request) put up a sign. They stoffed this up because it's placement can't be seen by cars. Our street is not kerbed and guttered, so when cars park the street becomes clogged and dangerous for pedestrians."
761,569,Road surface,General,"Due to frequent heavy double trucks on road there is a need for repairs from Pacific Highway to National Parks entrance. The heavy vehicles go to housing and flat-block construction plus the most traffic to North Turramurra golf/recreation civil work program, which will be great when finished."
762,57,"Littering, illegal parking, abandoned trolleys",Laws and Enforcement,I'm sick of living in a street that looks like a ghetto because other people are too selfish and lazy to put their unwanted junk mail in recycling and bring trolleys home and level them on the street.

764,571,Parking on narrow bend,General,Duncan street is already a narrow street but cars park on the bend or very close to it. It makes it difficult to go around as oncoming cars can't be seen. You need to go very slow and stop behind the parked cars to avoid accidents and let others through. As it a narrow bend if there is a car parked on the bend you have to drive over to the right. Some drivers also don't drive to left to as well when going around. This is also on the route for buses. It would be safer if there was no parking signs on and near the bend. It would be better as drivers will know that they can stay to the left going around the bend and not worry about having to stop or having to drive more to the right where other oncoming cars may be coming
765,572,Rubbish in park adjacent to renwick street chifley,General,Some ratbag has dumped an old washing machine and a metal frame (two separate locations) in the parkland adjacent to Renwick st. The rubbish is at the bottom of the park near Hindmarsh Drive. Could you please remove this rubbish.

768,575,Garden and footpaths maintanence,General,"The footpath verge has not been maintained/mowed in the last 9 months that I have resided in this area. I have had to do this myself and I believe this is not my responsibility. I am also not satisfied with the state of the median strip garden that is in my street. It has not been looked after, and the picket post and ropes that were put up when the estate was first established have still not been removed. They create a reversing hazard from the residences driveways."

770,577,Street light not working,General,"Hi there, The street light on the walkway in the corner of Friend Place and Farmingdale Drive has not been working for the last few months.

774,581,"Large, damaging pothole on Ernest Street at junction with Mountjoy Terrace",General,Causing suspension bottom-outs.
775,582,Road parking,General,I would like to see the road widened to allow 2 cars to easily pass each other possibly turning some of the turfed area into standard parking bays or more parking made available by creating 45 degree parking bays out of the turf areas. There are to many apartments for the amount of street parking and when the little street is busy it gets backed up as there is no room to pass each other.
776,583,Illegal and dangerous parking,General,In front of both schools Barker and barker Prep there is significant danger from peopel parking their cars constricting a two lane road to one

778,585,Rounderbout problem for users coming from left,General,"Approach from West has right turn lane on inside with left turn & straight on same arrow on nearside. Same applies to traffic from South. As traffic has to merge immediately after leaving roundabout, turning right into Empire Bay Dr & turning left into Avoca Drive, there should be no access from inside lanes"
779,586,No through road,General,The street is missing signs to traffic in both directions indicating that the road is a cul de sac. Many vehicle turn down this street to try and cross on to Boundary or Patterson roads however having to turn around and head back down the Princes Hwy
780,588,Speeding Cars on residential road,General,"Numerous cars come around the corner from Diggers Beach Road and ""Plant it"" resulting in skidding, particularly in the wet, fishtailing etc and as it is a down hill straight ,speeding down the street. This is a residential area with many residents crossing Firman Drive to get to the beach. There is a resort on one side of the road with numerous cars, parked outside the resort as well as coaches and mini buses. These cars are going in and out of the carpark at all times during the day. There have been many near misses and this is an area waiting for a disaster. It seems that this road is a well known spot if you want to ""hoon"" as the speeding activity has increased in recent years. Apart from the noise these cars make with their noisy engines, skidding tyres etc . The speeding cars can still be heard as they speed around to Charlesworth Bay road. I would think that traffic calmers would fix this problem. This is a dangerous situation. there are 5 driveways into AAnuka Beach Resort and three cross streets as well as numerous local residents walking across the road at various spots along the road to get to the beach. I was recently seeing my family off from my home and as my son was strapping his children into their seatbelts a car came around the corner , lost traction in the wet , fishtailed for a distance , towards my son's car and did a 180 degree spin with car facing in opposite direction when he came to a halt. This could have been a tragedy. Please investigate and consider doing something about this."
781,589,Road repairs needed,General,"As you come off the bridge opposite the service station (before the speed camera), there is a major bump, the level of the road and the bridge are not even, therefore if I am driving over this ever day at least once or twice a day there is bond to be damage to my suspension, that could be avoided. I would also like to highlight the risks of this uneven drop, when travelling behind trucks eg furniture trucks they come to an almost complete stop in this 70zone, I believe this is a hazard in its self."
782,59,Come sign the petition in barrack lane,Pothole,Great to see NRMA out in Parramatta to help promote the need for better road maintenance!
783,590,Bad road surface at intersection,General,The road way all a long bungarrabie rd is very poor and at the moment the side streets in my area are being resprayed this time would be better to fix bungarrabie rd as my suspension is getting worst since moving here over 18 months ago and the rates are the dearest
784,591,Graffiti & Dumped Goods,General,Power sub station with graffiti and dumped household goods eg TV.
785,592,Street parking,General,Morotai road is not very wide. Residents have in the past parked on the nature strips in front of their houses. Recently the police booked all the cars parked on the nature strip. Morotai road is a major thoroughfare to other streets in Revesby height as well as the 926 bus route. Since the police have booked people for parking on the nature strip a number of cars parked in the street have have side mirrors broken by passing vehicles. In addition when cars are parked on either side of the street there is quite often a line of up to 6 cars trying to pass along the street. This causes problems for people trying to reverse out of their driveways. This is particularly problematic given that we have a high number of elderly drivers living in the street. I would suggest that council construct tiled parking areas on the nature strips similar to what exist in sans souci such as in Bonney street. ( see Google street view for details)
786,593,Kennedy Drive constant ineffective repairs,General,"This road is a major pathway to the M1 on which literally thousands of vehicles travel each day. The road floods at any time we have heavy rain, it is always full of potholes, and gets dug up for one reason or another every year. This year it is for 4 months and it is causing chaos. Signs are posted to prevent right hand turns but no-one polices it and people just ignore the instruction. When repairs are done they only last until the next heavy rain because it is obviously only being patched up, not fixed properly. It is driving the local residents insane."
787,595,Ants nest in the gutter,General,"Would you kindly exterminate an ants nest located in the gutter on the left hand side of the upper side of Knibbs Street, Turner. The ants are invading my garden since March 2014 now into the backyard."
788,596,Blackwood way albion park rail,General,"Hi i live in whitewood pl which is only accessible via blackwood way i have lived here for 24 years, over the last 10 years every heavy rain we end up with pot holes all the council do is fill them after a month or so. so the road is made up off holes and repaired pot holes its long overdue to be resealed we have complained before but they do nothing."
789,597,Largest pothole ever seen,General,There is a large pothole which needs to be urgently corrected as this is a very busy area with high traffic and pedestrians walking from Kingsgrove Station to the bus stop and to the public car park. This area is also a busy drop off and pick up location. The pothole has been here for a while and there has been an attempt to fix however not correctly. Please see attached photos
790,598,Street light broken,General,The street light in front of 18 Hinkler St has been broken for at least a year

792,6,Pavement brick missing,,Trip hazard
793,60,Crushed and broken mouth to drain,Pothole,This creates a trip hazard and may result in flooding due to blockage of drain mouth.
794,600,Sandy road,General,"I have had my property around 13 years now and still have sandy,rocky,holes in my road. when it rains the holes get even bigger and i had to buy a small 4x drive."
795,602,Stormwater drainage,General,"Property flooding due to inadequate stormwater drainage. Woniora Road No.s 250, 252 and 254 are regularly flooded during heavy rain. Problem 1: Woniora Road at this location is a low point, catching water from King Georges Rd via Cheddar St, Taunton St, and Blakesley Rd. Problem 2: not enough street openings to the drain. Problem 3: Traffic speeds through creating waves, increasing water flow onto No.s 250 and 252. Problem 4: Collection bins are put in front of drains by neighbours across the road. Council has checked and says the drainage system is clear so the problem is not enough openings to the stormwater drainage system."
796,603,Carparking,General,Cars park too close to the intersection (within 10 metres). Makes it impossible to check for oncoming traffic when turning into Fletcher street from Murray Street.
797,604,No overtaking lane for 37kms west bound on Kings Highway,General,"Travelling West on Kings Highway, there is no overtaking lane from the top of the Clyde Mountain for 37kms (until just over the Shoalhaven River). This is an incredibly busy road and no overtaking lane for 37 kms is a recipe for disaster. There are in the area travelling East."
798,605,State of Road,General,"Uneven road surface, pot holes and road trenches that have not been filled in properly. These issues have been constant from the new industrial area at Marsden Park right up to where the old golf course and driving range used to be for the past 2 years. I have been in contact with RMS over and over again to no avail. It has gotten to the point where I couldn't live with the daily drive in my car with a sports tuned suspension and have traded to a 4wd to somewhat cope with the poor road conditions. I understand there is road works, but the road should be in a minimum condition that is not unsafe and cause damage to vehicles that have to use the road. Hopefully you can help. My next step is to approach the media."
799,606,Racing and Illegal Parking,General,"Due to speed cameras on Edgar st, this quiet street has now become a proxy for a link to the Hume highway. Also racing is becoming problematic day and night with footpaths unusable due to illegal parking it is highly dangerous to walk around. Two kids were nearly run over recently from cars going over 80km/hr. Plus a major high speed accident at glassop street intersection involving police and fire dept. A high value quiet street is becoming a hoon's playground due to lack of any traffic management and elderly are unable to walk around. Closing the street off at Marion st would eliminate high speed racing down the hill to time the lights at the highway plus fining illegal parkers.

We have noted several cracks forming around our doorways, which we have been advised could be caused by the vibrations caused by several hundred vehicles driving over an unevenly placed water hydrant each day.

826,636,Shrubs and dead trees needing removal,General,I have a number of dead shrubs on the other side of my fence which is next to a lane way. The kids in the neighborhood have been making this a spot to hang out and I'm worried they may end up setting these on fire. These bushes would burn very easily and are only meters from my house. My house is 36 Cartwright St. The lane way is next to me.
827,637,Road is dangerous for pedestrians and drivers.passenger's of vehicles,General,Open drains on the side of the road on both sides and when cars park on either side of the street it makes it very narrow and hard for traffic to pass.

850,659,Speeding Drivers,General,I have lived here for 8 years and I am finding that many younger drivers are driving down this street way too fast... especially in the afternoons and evenings. I think speed humps are called for around this road.
851,661,Poor Road Surface,General,"In Atkins Avenue, when the road was resurfaced about 6 years ago it was a very poor job. The surface is rough and gravelly in parts. We would like a normal smooth bitumen surface that other streets in Russell Lea have."

When turning right out of Elizabeth St if confronted by a vehicle coming from Harris St one has no alternative than to reverse into Elizabeth St. However depending on the speed of either vehicle this is often very sudden & dangerous even for cyclists. Perhaps a mirror at the ""No through Traffic"" sign would solve this problem."

858,669,Constant Flooding,General,We have constant flooding every time it rains. This is due to our street not having gutters and so water pools in the grass out front of our home.

866,679,Pothole,General,I have had an ongoing argument with Canada Bay Council. They repaired a pothole after I reported it and notified them that it caused rim and tyre damage requiring replacement. They refused compensation due to their Act stating they can only be liable if they are aware of the pothole before and that that pothole was repaired in September 2014. I have time and locate stamped photographs of the pothole and damage. How can I make them liable for this incident.

868,680,Showground road gosford,General,"Large amounts of traffic and poor road conditions are very dangerous. This road has little to no drainage and a very poor even surface to drive on. This is much worse for motorcycle riders. I have seen australia post bike riders come close to falling off their motorcycle , therefore that causes a workers' compensation case if not a fatality. Urgent funds are needed to fix this overdue problem."

It is damaging my car as well as many others. I have been very close to a accident on this corner as the person was going to fast and got airborne off the problem in the road. please get it fixed before someone if killed or the holes and lumps do major damage to local cars whom have to travel this road regularly to get to there houses.
872,686,Dangerous uneven road edge,General,The westbound side coming up the hill after crossing salt pan creek in lane 1 has a deep drop off into the gutter most of the way up the hill.

875,689,Shocking road surface,General,"From Mittagong Creek to Carlisle Street, Merrigang Street is a nightmare of poorly repaired potholes and cross road trenches. It is not comfortable or safe to drive at the posted 50 kmh speed limit. Recently Council fully renovated Merrigang Street from Bendooley Street to Mittagong Creek but totally ignored the stretch of road beyond, which was and is in a shocking state of repair, particularly for a significant through road."
876,69,Dreadful and dangerous intersection,General,"This intersection is one of the worst I have ever known. Turning left into Riddell Parade is like taking your life into your own hands. Cars speed through the blind corner and I have had many near misses. Many people ignore the no right turn into Shoobra, again at great risk. My driving instructor years ago told me to wind down the window and ""listen"" for oncoming cars! I think (and many neighbours) that it would be appropriate to close the end of Shoobra rd and have a small but attractive park area. There are other streets that have done this and it has been highly successful!"

I only use this if I have a passenger who can help me, otherwise I travel to Wyong where the lead in has been designed to allow safe merging."
881,695,Speeding and Road Surface,General,"This is a relatively narrow road with a 50km/h speed limit which is regularly ignored by speeding buses, taxis, motor cyclists and cars. Buses struggle to stay on their own side of the double white line and motorists exiting their parked cars on the north side of the road have little or no room to do so safely because of the width of the road and the speed of oncoming vehicles. Many people park on the north side and cross to enter the Manly/Spit walk opposite No 92. Aside from this, the road surface is poor - no work has been done on it for at least the past 4 years."
882,696,Traffic through roundabout,General,During busy hours (eg 3pm M to F) drivers are disobeying roundabout rules and constantly queue into the roundabout waiting to turn onto Broadway (southbound on Mountain Street).

887,700,Loftus Avenue : Poor Speed Limit Signage and Adherence,General,"Wish to confirm 50kph speed limit for entire length of Loftus Avenue ( from say First Avenue at Loftus end thru to Wheatley Road end in Yarrawarrah ). As a Loftus resident and daily user of Loftus Avenue I am concerned at not only the rapidly increasing traffic volumes but the speed and aggressive tailgating practices of many drivers who use Loftus Avenue as a main thoroughfare. Speed limit on the road was and still is, I think, limited to 50kph. Street and Road signage to this effect is sparse and in very poor condition. What traffic calming options are possible?"
888,702,Lights,General,All the street lights in the street have not worked for the last month.
889,704,Street light not working,General,The street light out the front of 4 and 6 Hinkler Street is not working. It was repaired a couple of days ago but since then has stopped working again

The situation is exacerbated by the proximity of a petrol station at the intersection of Summerland Circuit and Drakeford Drive. Given the frequent warnings we are receiving about the dangers from bushfires this coming year, the neglected bush area where so much fuel has accumulated over time is of concern to nearby residents. Finally, I draw your attention to the presence of Namadgi School diagonally opposite to the area identified, a school that would certainly be affected should a fire break out nearby."
895,710,Pot holes,General,More pot holes in the bike lane as well as car lane where bikes ride when it is not a clearway

898,713,Two large sunk patches,General,"There are two large sunk patches which need to be urgently corrected as this is a very busy area with high traffic where two lanes merge into one in downhill direction. It is very dangerous as drivers so often try to merge and avoid the patches at the same time. Also they cause constants high level of 'pothole-type' noise to the locals, days or nights. But worst thing is all of the local houses around the patches shake everytime there is a big car or truck passing by which can cause permanent structural damage. The patches have been here for a while and there has been an attempt to fix however not correctly as we can see it sunk and the problems got worst. The whole road seem to be resurface but for some reasons this section was left undone. Please see attached photo from Google Earth. Please fix this issue as soon as possible so we can live, sleep and work, our local council."

When travelling west on Wyralla at this intersection there is usually one or two cars legally parked on the eastern side of Kent St adjacent to the corner. The problem is that these cars totally obstruct vision of vehicles approaching along Kent St from Boronia Ave to Wyralla resulting in quite a few near misses.

916,735,Line marking,General,"Lines have faded on either side of the road to the west of the roundabout. Very dangerous for cyclists approaching or exiting the roundabout.

As a cyclist who uses the shoulder until this point, cars regularly cut me off despite me being ahead of them."

928,746,Street holes needing repair,General,The street holes in front of 39 White St. East Gosford already are a risk to walk or drive.
929,747,Streetlight out in Merrivale Lane,General,"The last streetlight at the end of Merrivale Lane is not working. It is a tricky corner for traffic, and the footpath is uneven."
930,749,Footpath hazard -pedestrian safety,General,"On the corner of Anembo Road and Waratah Road there is no kerbing and no guttering. After rain, the grassy area becomes a mud pit and cars going around the corner don't see where the road stops and the grass starts, causing several cars to lose control and pose a danger to residents and young children nearby. The problem is worsened by the fact that on this very same corner is a bus stop where the school bus stops every day, hence children do not have the choice to walk on the other side of the road. Additionally, across the road on waratah road is a children's day care centre which creates additional foot traffic all around this very same corner. It would also appear that during heavy rain, excess rainwater run-off from the council street floods into this grassy area without adequate drainage mitigation via appropriate kerbing and guttering. The installation of kerbing and guttering is a minimum to help remediate what poses an otherwise unacceptable safety risk to young children and residents who have no choice but to be using this particular section of the road. A proper footpath would be idea but as a safety measure, kerbing is required. The same corner has been responsible for several cars losing control and hitting walls and trees. Kerbing would be an inexpensive way to divert rainwater to drains, avoid mud pits and channel cars to correctly navigate the corner without spinning out onto the grass verge. Before someone gets killed or injured, I urge council to address this issue."
931,750,"Potholes in Nowack Ave, have been here for 8 years now",General,"In Nowack Avenue, Umina Beach (NSW 2257... Gosford Council) just where it enters Ocean Beach Road, the surface is completely unacceptable. Most traffic exiting Nowack Avenue turns left and has to roll over some terrible pots and dints. It also floods when it rains even moderately, so you can't even see them ! It has been like this for the 8 years we have lived in this street. This is not an out-of-the-way street either but just a lump of loose bitumen's throw from the CBD"
932,751,Dumped Car,General,Ygf 70p
933,752,Congestion from 4 to 6pm,General,There is minimal traffic flow of an afternoon/evening. Due to a backing up of traffic it will shortly start to block one lane of the M1 north and south bound with people waiting to get through Morisset. With the new housing developments going ahead this will only increase the problem very quickly.
934,753,Broken slabs on the street,General,On the intersection of Eager Street and Rothery Street there are a number of broken areas of the roadway. I have to slow right down because I fear for my tyres! It is a bit more than what I have always done because there is a real dip in the road there.
935,754,Remembrance driveway bargo,General,"Most the roads need fixing , I can't drive my car through most streets cause of the pot holes"
936,755,Traffic Lights,General,"Traffic Lights at the intersection of the New England Highway and South Seas Drive Ashtonfield only four vehicles to make the right hand turn onto the highway on a green light before changing to red. The lights require adjusting to allow more vehicles to make the right hand turn,limiting the bank up of traffic."
937,756,Mobbs Lane footpath,Footpaths,"Mobbs Lane, Epping, between Edenlee St and Midson Road; the footpath in this short section is uneven and very narrow for the amount of pedestrian movements; foliage has grown and covers half of the path width making it unnecessarily difficult to walk. Please widen the footpath, fix footpath and cut back vegetation."
938,759,Dangerous turn from Jubilee Street,General,"Coming from Jubilee Street turning right into Boundary Road is an extremely dangerous turn when the two car parks from the corner of Boundary and Jubilee in front of the Doctors are used. Due to the road dipping (for drainage) at that corner, as well as the two cars parked in front of the Doctors (especially if large makes, which most are now days) oncoming traffic along Boundary is only visible by coming out onto the roadway and risking coming in front of oncoming traffic. I have a reasonable size ford falcon and due to the dip the front lowers so this adds to the problem. A driver of a smaller and lower vehicle would have no visibility( if two cars are parked on the right) until it came right out nearly into the middle of the roadway. The problem has been reported previously to the Mayor, 6 months ago via a radio phone in."
939,76,Lighting on Territory Land,General,Please organise a extra street light for safety reasons as this part of the street is very dark at night time

Motorists and especially Motorcyclists need to take care."
942,763,Lighting,General,The streetlight out front of our home has blown and I believe it to be poor security for our home and vehicles
943,764,Road buggered,General,Road base is falling apart. Was resurfaced about 12 months ago as a patch up to shut up local residents with only tar pored over the top. Underneath is bad & entire road needs to be rebuilt

950,771,Billowing clouds of dust,General,"Extreme dust problem made worse by cars, trucks, farm vehicles, school buses etc using the lane at speed as an easy bypass completely avoiding the city. This dirt road is also in a bad state of repair, and has been reported to Council many times over the years as well as the newspaper. The new housing estate will make it even worse"
951,772,New 60km/h speed limit approaching Taren Point Bridge.,General,"A new 60km/h sign has been placed to I assume reduce the speed of motorists approaching Taren Point Bridge, (heading south to Taren Point)the problem is most motorists are ignoring it and even if you sit in the far left lane and obey the 60km/h limit you are overtaken by trucks, buses and cars. There are now also 5 speed limit changes during school zone time, before the school it is 70, then 40, then back to 70 before the new 60 zone approaching the bridge with the old 80 limit over the bridge, all within a few kilometres."
952,773,Fix my street,General,"Too many pot holes, rough surface."
953,774,Big pothole,General,"A big pothole in a quite busy road. Very dangerous as cars tend to avoid it but space is limited due to the street being used for car parking too. As I live in te house in front of this pothole, I've already seen few low cars get damaged when falling in this pothole. It's located at 36/38/40 Cook Street, Turrella, 2205 (corner with Reede street)."

959,78,Traffic lights out at Bandjalong and Bindubi,General,"14:20h Thurs 7 Nov. Traffic lights at the intersection of Bandalong and Bindubi St in Aranda/Cook are out. School is about to let out, and children will be trying to cross the road enroute home, so I hope you can come quickly!"
960,780,Condition of road,General,Along the front boundary of 8 Lakeview Road Morisset Park on both sides of the road the edge of the road has broken away which is a potential safety hazard to traffic using Lakeview road. Additionally the road in that area is showing signs that it in the early stages of breaking up.

962,782,Worst road in Murwillumbah,General,"Fix it properly!!! This road has had patch after patch after patch, resulting in the bumpiest road surface that shakes the shit out of your car. Needs to be ripped up and start again. - Annoyed local resident."
963,783,Speed limit,General,"All streets on the central coast are 50kph unless signed differently. Why then in the Matcham /Holgate area is it 60kph? Carlton Wattle Tree & Coachwood roads are narrow twisting hilly & have many concealed drive ways. While I accept that council has only so much to spend, surely lowering the speed limit would be an obvious move & cost effective way of making this area so much safer. We have seen many accidents, sadly one a fatality, & even more near misses."
964,784,Great entry to town NOT!,General,Dodgy repair jobs of a mass of potholes have created a horrible surface right as you enter into town from the bridge. Needs fixing properly!
965,785,Missing give way sign,General,A post appeared to be pushed down and cut off at the base on the cement island

968,788,Road resurfaced,General,Recently the road was resurfaced from Alma Rd to Weinwright Avenue including Patterson Close at Padstow Hts - tar was layed on the existing surface and then stones - amazing that there are more loose stones and gravel on the road which is dangerous for not only drivers but including motor bike riders. Including a section on the left side of the road in Weinwright Avenue appoaching the intersection at Patterson Close has uneven sections where it appears that no repairs have been made but to just put tar over it. Very unsatisfactory job and still waiting for the removal of the loose stones on the road. I wonder why it has taken so long to retify even when contacting the council about this matter. Thank you
969,789,Curbing lack of.,General,"Wychewood ave needs to have the curbing completed starting at number 1up to 25 Wychewood ave,cars,buses and trucks are endangering people who have to walk on the road. Also the vibration from heavy vehicles are possibly causing damage to houses."
970,79,Mirror needed,General,"Coming out of Wheatley Street on to Castleton Crescent, there is a blind corner to the right and people often speed past there. If a mirror were placed opposite the Wheatley St exit, you would be able to see cars heading towards you rather than having to speed out and hope for the best."
971,790,Light is out,General,Street light not working in culdesac. Very dark at night to put bins out. Thank you
972,791,Murrays Run Road is dangerous,General,"Murrays Run Road is 14km of dirt road which provides the ONLY access to Burralong Valley (37 properties), and many other properties on Murrays Run itself. It is currently (and often is, despite occasional grading) dangerous. It's essentially a single-lane road, with numerous blind bends. It is so pot-holed as to be almost unnavigable. Cars are driven to avoid deep potholes, often going around bends on the wrong side of the road. There have been numerous ""near misses""; a crash, with injury and possible death, is inevitable. Council does not grade the road nearly as often as it needs, and often not very well."
973,792,Street lamp not working,General,The street lamp at the end of the cul de sac outside 123 Kingsford smith Drive is not working.
974,793,Pothole,General,A pothole (about 30cm diameter) has opened recently on the McKellar side of the road

976,795,Missing Pit Lid,General,There is a missing lid from a pit located on pedestrian footpath. There is a piece of plywood covering the missing lid so no one falls in.
977,797,Damaging potholes,General,Elizabeth Street is full of damaging potholes which are only filled with loose gravel and these are getting worse daily.
978,799,Road breaking up,General,Road pavement breaking up along full length of road.
979,80,Early morning and weekend construction noise,General,"Construction work regularly starts around 6am every week day. Construction work also start early on Saturday mornings. This noise is very loud and disturbs my sleep. This noise consists of general construction, power tools and the running of trucks and constant truck reversing warning sounds can be heard. This is an ongoing issue that has been happening for several weeks/months."
980,800,Potholes,General,Potholes that had some bitumen thrown in them last week have not been fixed at all and after the first day all the fill had been flicked out all over the place. Large sections of Castlewood Drive have been marked for fixing but no progress so far. This is the 632 bus route so the buses which come by every half hour are taking their toll on the road surface.

985,806,Stop Sign and Parking restrictions,General,"When I ride my bike along the Nelson Road bike route vehicles constantly nose out of Havilah Road in order to see approaching traffic. This is a serious issue for riders. Implementing a proper ""No Stopping"" zone in both Havilah road approaching Nelson road and In Nelson road would give a better line of sight and a ""Stop Sign"" for traffic from Havilah Road would make the road safer."
986,807,Lane markings,General,"Increasingly, cars are turning right onto Lambton Rd from Curley Rd, using the left hand lane. This compounds traffic congestion when the traffic lights are synchronised for a green left turn arrow to cycle through - a right turning car from left lane can stop a long line of cars from turning left. We just need some turning arrows painted on the lanes here please so that the left lane of Curley Rd is left turn only and the right lane is right turn only. Thanks"
987,809,Road subsidence,General,Dangerous collapse of road surface near no 157
988,81,Abandoned vehicle,General,"The vehicle is on a bend parked almost a metre out from the curb and has been here with no plates for well over a week , its a hazard and its removal should be marked a high priority by the rangers. (It has been marked)"
989,810,Potholes and unstable edge,General,This road is in complete disarray. the street is wide enough that two cars should be able to safely pass but ot reduced to one lane due to multiple ( hundreds) of refilled potholes that reemerge after even the briefest of storms. It is a main thoroughfare and needs an urgent upgrade including curb and guttering.

994,815,Speeding motorists,General,"Drivers are using the hilly section of Burraneer Bay Road between Port Hacking Road and Yathong Road Caringbah South as a race track. It is supposed to be a 50km/h zone however as residents we constantly observe cars clearly not following the speed limit. Years ago there used to be a 'speed cameras used in this area sign' however that is long since gone and sometimes you see a police car doing speed checks on the other side of port hacking road which has adjusted driver behaviour. With large boats parked on the roadside, concealed driveways just over the crest could I please request either more police presence or signage advising of potential speed cameras. I asked RMS to bring their mobile speed cameras to the area but was advised it would not happen for some time. Nothing slows people down faster then a highway patrol police car, please, something needs to be done as this road is being used as an alternative to the kingsway. While I accept increased traffic as part of the areas growth it is unacceptable for motorists to drive well above the speed limit on a residential street.thank you."
995,816,Potholes,General,"Massive potholes on Rajah Road requiring swerving on approach to a crest..just a ,matter of time before there is a serious accident. Plus the damage to our cars. Are we as residence (rate payers) supposed to pay for the damage to our tyres & wheels.??"
996,818,Street Lights not working,General,"Street light between 19 and 21Jacka Crescent Campbell works intermittently and when it does work it;s a very faint light and light at 27 Jacka Crescent Campbell is completely out of order, With both lights out of order it makes that section of Jacka Crescent very dark and dangerous for pedestrians and local residents."
997,819,Crater hole in road,General,"There is a massive hole in the road caused by God knows what. One of the residents on the street has recently fallen over due to it. Please sort this out. This hole could consume a wheel and possibly many small children at once. If it rained a substantial amount I could swim in this hole. Gravel from the hole spills out onto the street like marbles for motorbikes. My number is 0404563322, my name is Bill please call me if you are confused about location. This is an urgent problem."
998,82,Deep pothole,General,Rain has waged out quite a large pothole.
999,820,Cahill Expressway over Circular Quay,General,"I am writing to you about a dangerous section of the Cahill Expressway, where the speed limit is set very low, prompting extremely aggressive behaviour on the part of some drivers."
1000,821,Parking & lack of public transport,General,"The Avenue has only apartment blocks, no houses, most of the blocks have no parking facilities. Woollahra Council has a car park for the sporting events which the residents are not allowed to use any longer than 1hr in the winter months (football). Parking permits are allocated 1 per unit but there is no public transport available other than to Circular Quay via the harbour & Kings Cross or from Edgecliff then a train or a ferry to Circular Quay. Woollahra Council knowing all the complaints re available parking in the street gave permission to build Cranbrook School and take over the playing fields in the area. They also have sporting events every weekend and training during the week (evenings). The parking in the street is used by the visiting teams. Now they have introduced a Communal Garden which also requires heavy vehicles, personal parking etc and there is not enough car space for the residents of the area. When there is an event e.g. circuis in Lyon Park the people attending ask where is the nearest available parking and they are referred to our streets. The ferry commuters are also referred to park in our streets. When will this council even give consideration to the residents of Rose Bay Garden Estate and why won't they build a car park and/or install public transport. Suggestion: Put a continuous running bus on running from the ferry wharf to bondi beach which will free up parking in both areas and enable ferry commuters living off O'Sullivan and Curlewis Sts to easily get from Bondi to the ferry and vice versa. Ferries are a very comfortable way for aged people to travel because they are usually on flat levels and the gangways are wide and short."
1001,822,Today's Forum at Eastern Suburbs Leagues Club,General,"Thank you for the opportunity to attend this well presented forum. I gather you noticed that the majority of guests who aired their views were all about road, parking, re-application for license (85++) problems and no issues regarding travel on public transport because we simply cannot get on a train and travel without having to use stairs or escalators. The buses are difficult because they are hard to get on board and rarely stop at convenient locations e.g. St Vincent's Hospital. Ferries are easy to travel on from Rose Bay but to get there by public transport is a nightmare almost impossible for aged people. Please give this some thought."
1002,823,Large holes in road with water gushing out,General,Reported problem to Sydney Water who said they may take 21 days to fix but the holes in the road are large and getting larger
1003,824,"Street there, but not sealed...!",General,I own 2 properties where I've pinpointed on the corner there berrembed street side. But there is street there that connects to balaro street.

1008,829,The Ridgeway constant pot holes along it,General,"There are constant pot holes along The Ridgeway way all the way from Bishendens Road Lisarow to Holgate.

1012,833,Graffiti & Speeding Drivers,General,"Regularly suburb is inundated with 'gangs' of youths who are rowdy & under influence of alcohol. Householders do not venture onto street but wait till morning to determine what damage has been inflicted. Often rubbish is strewn on road or footpath area & Graffiti painted on fences.

1014,835,A car parks too close the roundabout,General,A holden commdore parks to close the roundabout.When drivers want to turn left they have to change lanes across unbroken line to turn left on to walker street. Make it a clearway or no parking zone.
1015,836,End of Reycroft ave is too dark.,General,At night the End of Reycroft ave in front of 29 and 31 is too dark can't see if there someone or a cat is walking across the road put a street light between 29 and 31 to light up the end of the street
1016,837,Broken access cover in left lane,General,There is a steel and concrete access cover in the left lane with several segments of concrete missing. This is a major hazard for cyclists descending mona vale road.
1017,838,Pot Holes,General,"The street was dug up some time ago and then filled in, but with the rain and trucks using the street large pot holes have developed. Council has been called a number of time and nothing has been done. The pot holes are getting worse and soon you will not be able to avoid them. I have a fairly new car and am worried that it will get damaged from these pot holes as at night they are hard to see."
1018,839,Flashing School Zone Signs,General,"St. Euphemia College Bankstown has two school entrances for students and parents to enter. The two entrances include Stacey Street & East Terrace. The East Terrace road does not have flashing school zone signs , to alert drivers that school zone speeds are in force. On many occassions motorists speed through the school crossing which also does not have a Lollipop controlled pedestrian crossings. As a result their has been many near misses over the years of both parents and children nearly run over at the crossing. I ask that you raise this matter with council as a high priority. I would like to see both Flashing school zone signs and a lollipop controlled pedestrian crossing installed on the East Terrace pedestrian crossing to operate during the school zone hours."
1019,840,Construction activity and material on the street,General,"Hi The top of this street is blocked by a rubbish skip, left over construction materials and vehicles - why cannot the builder use his own site and not the street??"
1020,841,Road surface,General,Road surface damaged
1021,842,Poor & Dangerous Road.,General,"Road too narrow & surface in very poor condition with increasing traffic use .This is the second year I have reported this with no results to date. Why does it appear that we need to have a major accident or death before action is taken?This road is between Pacific Hwy.& Mulloway Road, Chain Valley Bay.N.S.W.2259."
1022,844,Pot holes,General,"From flying fox lane, vacy the road has many pot holes and divetts. Very scary when traffic coming the other way especially with trucks. Also vacy bridge exit is a nightmare."

1031,853,Accident prone intersection urgently needs attention.,General,Personally I was in a near fatal T-bone accident. A vehicle running a stop sign travelling about 60kph collided into the drivers door and I was fortunate to have a lucky escape with no serious injury. I live on Park St. about 100 meters from this intersection and see and hear incidents all the time here. I would like to see some form of traffic obstacle to slow traffic down along Redman Street on approach to this intersection. I have also witnessed cars travelling along Park Street coming from Canterbury Road traveling at ridiculous speeds sometimes over 80kph and I would really like to see speed humps put in place to slow them down.
1032,854,Multiple street lights out,General,"I counted approximately 8 street lights on this interchange that were not working. I couldn't inspect the whole interchange, so there may be more. Might be indicative of a larger problem?"

1036,858,Footpath Damaged,General,"Foot path in numerous sections has severe cracking, posing a trip hazard to pedestrians and visitors to the local businesses."
1037,859,Parking,General,"The northern end of Spencer St. is signposted for parking which allows parking to 5 meters from the corner. The southern end, adjacent to Welesley St., is not signposted which limits parking to 10 meters from the corner. This means the street loses 2 car spots. Trees in the street already limit available parking. This situation affects many streets in the Sydney inner west. Please either signpost the southern end of the street or change the allowable distance for non- signposted streets."
1038,86,Graffiti,General,"There is graffiti sprayed on the traffic control signs along Russell Street, between Old Bathurst Road and the M4."
1039,860,Bumpy Road to Hospital,General,The road to hospital is in terrible state especially if being transported to hospital via ambulance for people with severe problems please fix street
1040,861,Urgent attention - Low trees,General,We travel upto 5m high.
1041,862,Urgent attention- low trees,General,We travel upto 5m high.
1042,863,Dangerous and very difficult access.,General,We tow busses in and out of Telford tours on the other side of the bridge. Now that the council put a new median opposite the bridge we are now forced to go over the top of the one on the bridge and is very dangerous as we may roll over.
1043,864,Low power lines.,General,We tow busses in and out of Telford tours upto 5m high. The power lines hanging low over the road need to be raised up to at least 5.3m high.
1044,865,"U-turn in peak hour traffic, require a no u-turn sign",General,At this intersection there is currently a no U-turn sign at this intersection when diving to athllon drive. When driving to hindmarsh there is no sign and motorists perform a U-turn there to get to the car yards at the end of Melrose drive. As there is no right turn lane (as there is no street to turn right into) I have a few close calls with either nearly running up the back of the car performing the U-turn or cars running into the back of me when I stop dead in the right hand lane. I believe a sign should be at this intersection on both sides of the road.
1045,866,Potholes,General,"The lower part of Cummins Street, Unanderra, has lines of potholes along the wheel tracks. Beyond that, there is some pavement failure further up the hill."
1046,867,Dangerous narrow road,General,"High Street in Caringbah has a high volume of local traffic, a high volume of through traffic as well as a high volume of street parking due to the units, townhouses and the shopping complex located in the street. The street is very narrow from the centre island towards Caringbah Rd and at most times of day, there is only enough room for one car to travel in any direction at a time. Cars have to pull to the side to allow cars coming from the other direction to pass. Rear view mirrors are often knocked off parked cars due to the narrow road and passing cars not having enough room. Some people speed down the road as fast as they canso they can get to the other end before any incoming cars come. With lots of residents and children in this area, this is extremely dangerous. This road needs to be made a one way street from the traffic island towards caringbah road to improve safety."
1047,868,Fallen tree,General,"There is a tree that has been fallen onto 5 bayswater st, st johns park nsw 2176. It is now has fully fallen and is blocked half of the road. It was half blown down 2 weeks ago buy the wind."
1048,869,Driveway of 9 Lefroy St Griffith A.C.T,General,A large pot hole has reoccurred in exactly the same spot you repaired it last time .I feel maybe there is an underlying problem which needs to be further investigating rather than just doing the usual thing and filling it with a bucket full of tar.It is considerably much larger than when u repaired it last
1049,87,Weeds,General,Appreciate in the Giffen Close island could be sprayed for weeds as they are bursting out all over!
1050,870,Potholes,General,Could the potholes at the lights wattle grove drv & Heathcote rd be repaired north bound
1051,872,Please make it an official pedestrian crossing,General,"Front of club rivers rear entrance. Since i have started picking up my kids from st joseph catholic riverwood, we have to dodge traffic coming from both direction since all parking available is on the other side of school."
1052,873,Relocate pedestrian crossing on cnr Launceston street and Hindmarsh Drive,General,"The traffic island at the corner of Launceston Street and Hindmarsh Drive in Lyons has the lowered pedestrian crossing too close to the intersection. This means that when cars are waiting to turn right onto Hindmarsh drive, they completely block the crossing, making it difficult for pedestrians and bicycles to cross safely. I suggest moving the crossing at least one car length back, or removing the island completely from one car length back from the intersection to allow others to cross safely."
1053,874,Excessive speed in residential area,General,Too often Buses and cars speed down Tremere street as a short cut between Zoeller St and Burwood Road. Traffic calming devices should be put on streets to slow the cars down especially in residential areas where there are kids about
1054,876,Traffic signals,General,"The traffic signals installed here have been a waste of time to the community, and are used as a revenue raiser by police."
1055,877,Parked Cars make it extremely difficult to make a right-hand turn onto Glebe Road,General,Cars parked outside the business on the corner of King Street and Glebe Road reduce traffic visibility and make it extremely dangerous at times to make a right-hand turn from King Street onto Glebe Road. This is coupled with the fact that Glebe Road curves and climbs at this point making it difficult to see oncoming traffic. I think that parking on Glebe Road at the front of this business should be restricted or prohibited.
1056,879,Pot holes on road to Scout Hall,General,Multiple potholes on roadway leading to scout hall at the corner of Koorabel and Euroka St West Wollongong and Also on the Koorabel and Bukari St intersection
1057,88,Broken steps,Footpaths,Missing bricks on these steps create a serious slip hazzard.
1058,880,Potholes,General,There are potholes on the junction of quarry way and peachgrove st making them hard to avoid
1059,881,Poor lighting effectiveness,General,"The lighting effectiveness in this street between the tennis courts and Beecroft Road is low due to trees covering existing lights and not enough lights for the street. For safety reasons, I request a pruning of branches on trees and installation of at least one more light please"
1060,882,Road Surface Deterioration,General,"The southbound left lane of Bourke St between Urana St & Fernliegh Rd is a disgrace, this section has been in poor repair for approx 12-18 months."
1061,883,Illegal uturn,General,Ever since the council put a barrier in the middle of the road to stop vehicles turning right on to brunker road Vehicles now do illegal uturns by turning in my driveway and neighbors driveways and sometimes almost hitting our vehicles Im worried as i have kids her play in the driveway and i fear a vehicle may run them over Please something has to get done as the council is the one who caused this
1062,885,Dangerous bend in road,General,The bend the road in question during market day and or sporting events narrows so that cars can no longer pass without making contact. Most will stop but a few will drive through at speed making contact with mirrors which has happened on many occasions. Could a no stopping zone be installed on one side of the road to allow two way traffic movement?
1063,886,Rut across road,General,In front of 29 Lisa Crescent there is a rut across the road where a trench was never properly finished off/topped up after the fill settled.
1064,887,Large areas of potholes,General,"The surface of this road is disgusting from the intersection at Pacific Highway most of way to Tumbi Road, quite some kilometers. If a little bit of tar is replaced it is only a metter of a couple of weeks and it has started to break up again. Not only the potholes but there is a large stretch extremely narrow as well, with no exaggeration. I would attach a photo but consider too dangerous o stand on side of road"

1066,889,Pothole,General,Pothole 30 cm deep south edge of bells place 80 m from intersection
1067,89,"Failure of Council to provide safe traffic conditions for residents due to prking conditions for work ve at adjacent ""light"" industrial arera.hicles, visitors and employees",General,"Please see attached copy of recent submission to Council. The only acknowledgement was from Councillor Michael Platt, who said he would discuss the question of parking restrictions with Council. Subsequently, agenda item:- ""further extension of parking restrictions from the Princes Highway to the vicinity of 264 West Street, Carlton"", was listed for Council's meeting held on Tuesday, 3 December, 2013. Final determination was completed at the next meeting on 9 December, when it was advised that the matter had been referred to the Kogarah Local Traffic Committee and not approved asit was ""not considered in the best interests of all properties in the Street, negatively impacting on parking availability. There are only twelve private residences (six on each side of the street), located between the ""light ""industrial area and the Princes Highway, and parking availability outside all of these homes is nil, due the the impact of parking practices of the occupants and visitors of nearby factory premises, contrary to Council's requirement to provide offstreet parking. incumbent on Council and owners of the industrial premise to resume space inorder to erect a suitable Parking Station, at the joint cost to Council and and a Council Rates Levy on each industrial site owner. Regards, Reg & Iris Kirkwood In the absence of any other action, we consider it"
1068,890,Parking on Corner - Dangerous Obstruction,General,"When turning right from Garnet Avenue into Grove Street it is necessary to nose out blindly into potential oncoming traffic in order to see if it is clear to turn. This is because vehicles are always parked right on the very corner of Grove Street. There hasn't been a collision yet, but there are regular close calls. Suggest landscaping corner to prevent parking so close to corner."
1069,891,Pot holes,General,I have reported the dire state of Left Bank Rd and Frasers Rd to Byron Shire Council months ago. I have not had a response. Frasers Rd has so many pot holes that is turning back into a dirt road.
1070,892,"Frasers Rd-broken road surface, potholes, eroded shoulder",General,"Many large potholes, cracked road surface, shoulder eroded with gullies forming, combined with steep, narrow road with tight bends and dropoffs = dangerous conditions. This problem has been getting worse with time and no repairs have been done to this road in years."
1071,893,Bicycle hazard,General,Tar has come away from around a concrete hydrant cover forming deep holes around it. It is right in a choke point for traffic. It would be great next time road maintenance is up there they could stick a bit more tar in there. Thanks on advance.
1072,894,Excessive speed,General,"Hill Street is a major arterial road between Lake Road,Lord Street and Pacific Drive. The corner of Hill Street and Owen Street has a Stop sign to stop traffic on Owen Street when crossing or entering Hill Street. Vehicles rarely stop! I live at this corner and have seen many near misses and several serious accidents, and fatalities. Vehicles using Hill Street always travel at excessive speed. Some sort of speed deterrent needs to be used in Hill Street. Speed humps, roundabouts, narrowing of road,etc should be considered."
1073,895,Potholes,General,Potholes in road surface at bottom of driveways to numbers 3 and 5 and also between house number 5 and 7.
1074,896,Kerb and road surface,General,There is a small height difference between bottom of the kerb and the road surface. When cars with low chassis are moving the bottom is scraping the kerb. I reckon the road surface has to be raised in level with the kerb.

Luckily no one else was in the road having the same problem in the opposite direction.
1086,908,Trees overhanging the road,General,"Along Canberra Avenue somewhere between the Monaro Highway and Eyre St, where I turn off, there are giant old trees overhanging the road. This is not a problem to cars, but I followed a really tall truck and it had to drive up the centre of the road to avoid the branches on each side. Perhaps some trimming could prevent this."
1087,909,Broken shoulder of road,General,"Due to recent increase of heavy vehicles along Maitland Road and council garbage trucks, Telstra service vehicles accessing communication pit, Energy Australia accessing power pole and a number of vehicles making U turns pot holes and erosion of the road shoulder the rode is now unsafe for walking and bicycles"
1088,91,Missing bollard in lane way,General,"Hi guys, several years ago one of the concrete bollards in the lane way beside my house was repaired/replaced with a treated pine bollard. This bollard got knocked out several times and each time I put it back in the ground. The last time I saw it knocked out by the landscape direct mowing contractor and it has been missing ever since. The biggest issue is now the pedestrian access to the reserve has become a vehicle access. This is regularly used by local goons to take their cars and trail bike into the reserve to race them around. This is one of four reserve access points on my street. All the other access points have metal cross over barriers to prevent illegal vehicle access but still allow walkers or bike riders. Could you please have the bollard replace and if possible upgrade the barrier so it matches the rest of the street.o"
1089,910,Pothole,General,"There is a pothole which is quickly increasing in size and depth, located out front of number 5 Fraser St, centre of the road.

In the past you have mowed down and poisoned the weeds.
1092,913,Intersection with Spring Range Road and Carrington Road,General,"This intersection has low visibility when approaching Carrington Road from the south. Semi trailers, who daily use the road, can't turn left at the intersection corner from Carrington Road without crossing to the wrong side of the road across solid double white lines. The intersection is also a problem for traffic using the turning lane into Carrington Road - many residents have close encounters with vehicles cutting the corner."
1093,914,Hole,General,"Hole in street, it could be dangerous"
1094,915,Danger,General,"Steep, narrow, busy residential street leading to shopping centre which many cars travel in either direction at dangerous speed. As it very often has cars parked either side as well, it makes it unsafe for residents trying to enter or leave their properties. The street needs'traffic calming' devices placed appropriately."

1100,922,Roundabout at Hall drive and Old Illawarra Road Menai,General,When stopped at the Give Way sign exiting Hall Drive trying to turn right into Old Illawarra road it is becoming increasingly difficult and quite dangerous at times to enter the Roundabout. The traffic approaching from my right make no attempt to even slow down let a lone give way at the sign. Me and my family which includes 2 learner drivers have been involved in many near misses and road rage incidents which have been caused by people being abusive to us on the roundabout after they come through the intersection at high speed. I feel this intersection needs a safer solution. Looking forward to a resolution as the traffic increases daily.
1101,923,Dangerous potholes,General,"There are a couple of large potholes Eastbound on General Holmes Drive at the entrance to the airport tunnel. These are extremely dangerous to the large numbers of cyclists that use the road as the only access south of Sydney.

1111,935,Blind intersection,General,"It is an accident waiting to happen. You cannot see up Derwent Pde. when coming out of Hilltop Ave. It is really scary if you are needing to turn right, as you are basically turning blind. IF A SPEED HUMP WERE PLACED ON DERWENT PDE. JUST BEFORE HILLTOP AVE IT WOULD MAKE IT MUCH SAFER. Thank you very much for fixing the previous Rd we advised you about. I am sure that there are many thankful motorists as a result of the action taken almost immediately and that was erecting No Stopping signs during peek hours along Bungarribee Rd between Resevoir and Flushcombe Rd. The traffic has improved out of sight in peek hour as a result of this. Thank you very much."
1112,937,Footpath dangerously close to road,General,"When travelling along the footpath at the Jetty Foreshores, heading south, you make a sharp left hand turn to follow the path towards the boat ramp. At this bend the road is very close with no barrier or boundary between. If you take the corner a bit wide, due to others using the path, bike riders etc, you could find yourself on the road where cars cut the corner. I have stopped taking my grandchildren on their bikes to this area for this reason. I would like to see some sort of barrier to keep the children safe. Thanks"
1113,938,Unsafe speed,General,"Many drivers use this street as a link between bush land dr and Cowper st, with majority travelling well above the speed limit, making it very dangerous for children and elderly especially as no footpaths. Speed humps would be a good deter ant for these persons."

I am worried that it's only a matter of time until this poses a risk of damage to a property or person.

1130,955,School crossing required,General,I would like to know the procedure to take to request a pedestrian crossing being made for the school children of St josephs catholic high school. This is an extremely busy main road and because there is a major bus stop the whole length of the school the parents have to drop their children off on the opposite side of the road. This is extremely dangerous at the beginning and end of the day as parents make u turns and nearly run over the kids crossing the road. There is a crossing outside of the public high school that is 2 to 3 kilometers down the road and this is way too far away. No matter what school our children attend they all deserve the right to be safe. It would be very much appreciated if this matter could be resolved. Thanks for your time.
