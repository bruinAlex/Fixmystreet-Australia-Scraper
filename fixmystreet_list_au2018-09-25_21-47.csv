I believe the condition of the road surface are adding to the problem. I think the biggest problem is the speeding buses and trucks. I have noticed cracking on the ceiling of my property . The vibration and shaking is almost constant, and at peak bus times is unbearable."

This was probably the largest bang i've ever heard while driving.. Seriously you really need to fix it... not only is it dangerous to try to avoid it, but if you do happen to run over it you will be disorientated for a few seconds because the impact is so heavy."

It would be great to have this fixed at same time as more noticeable ones on the road."
43,1110,Street light out,General,"Street light out making the street very dark. Western side of the street, last light before Osgood Ave."
44,1112,"Incorrect Signage, Eastbound lanes",General,Approximately six months ago the intersection of Macquarie Road and the Great Western Highway was modified to prevent Macquarie Road traffic turning right onto the highway. Traffic travelling eastbound on the highway and approaching the site of the previous intersection see a sign warning of an intersection which no longer exists.
45,1113,Drug Dealing,General,"Young drivers, P plate drivers continually use this quiet dead end street to deal drugs and take drugs. They also park inside the Sir Eric Woodward memorial school to do the same. Drug paraphernalia and rubbish left both on the road and in the school car park."
46,1114,Congested and pavement damage,General,This street is a main road with a massive amount of traffic on it each day. Yet it is narrow and the pavement is damaged severely. Cars are parked on both sides of the street even though it is not wide enough to carry the sheer volume of traffic due to council approving high density housing yet not providing adequate off street parking. Being close to the university also means foot traffic is high yet there is no foot path but rough and damaged sides. Very run down and over used street.
47,1115,No Parking: Kiss and ride,General,"Outside Edgeworth Public School There are sins No Parking with Kiss and ride. I understand the kiss and ride in the morning, but in the afternoon cars are parked for 20 to 30 minutes in a no Parking zone waiting to pick up their kids. Some park across the crossing and the gate to the carpark. Some do a U-turn over double lines to park. This is creating a very dangerous situation. I have seen cars narrowly miss the Lollipop lady and other pedestrians including myself and my granddaughter."
48,1116,Roundabout sign knocked down,General,Roundabout sign on the northbound approach to this round about has been struck down flat. Still in ground but very dangerous.

The nearby intersections have roundabouts except Brickfield/Gladstone Streets which is very perplexing to me. I've submitted my request to Councillor James Shaw on 26/11/2015 which he passed on my request to Parramatta's Council's Traffic Committee. Since then I haven't heard any news of the outcome of my request."

55,1129,Cars parked in street not allowing safe passage for other cars and also pedestrians,General,"The amount of cars that park on both sides of this street is dangerous to traffic especially when coming around corner. No room for pedestrians as there is no path and pedestrians must use the road also have to go around parked cars and when two cars are conversing in opposite directions it is very dangerous. Many cars have been side swiped in this street, next will be a pedestrian"
56,1131,Parking white lines in Wire Lane .,General,"At the moment vehicles are able to park at the intersection of Wire Lane and Crookston Drive due to first and second housing developements not changing the road markings .As the roads have traffic islands ,bigger vehicles have difficulty turning into Crookston Drive due parked vehicles on the end of the street.Crookston Drive is also a bus route."

62,1142,It is at end of road,General,22 Greville Ave is at the very end of the road not 600 meters as shown on your map
63,1143,Line marking,General,"All of Isles Drive needs to be marked due to the large number of cars now parked there daily as staff and visitors to the hospital refuse to pay for parking on the grounds. It is getting quite dangerous to drive around the area as many people cannot park correctly or safely (eg: too close to intersections or driveways) - this is a heavily utilised industrial and commercial area and it is only a matter of time before a serious accident occurs. Also, the intersection with the Pacific Highway at the lights has no markings or arrows and some drivers get it into their heads to make up road rules as they please such as turning left from the right lane and justifying it by saying if there are no lines or arrows that it is legal - more opportunity for accidents and road rage. Can the community please have someone stand up and show some proactive thinking? Don't wait until it's too late."
64,1145,Storms are pit above road height,General,The storm water pit sits about 10cm road height causing a dangerous situation. An attempt to patch was made yesterday but still the problem is still there. Also this street has many others which council fix some but not others..
65,1146,Lifted curb driveway ramp,General,The curb in front of my driveway is lifted so that the front of my car scrapes when driving in.
66,1148,Hole as big as a garbage bin!,General,Very large hole never addressed by Byron shire council in years. Always have to move over to the left to avoid. Non locals would not see and avoid at night. Well overdue!
67,115,Weeds,General,Weeds are growing where the edge of gutter meets road just past the entrance onto Britten-Jones Drive from Southern Cross. Could you please spray them. This is a common problem along Britten-Jones Drive. Could there be a regular spraying of weed growth along our street. It would appear our street is missed as opposed to other areas of Holt. Thankyou
68,1159,"Aggressive bumps, concrete obstacles and bike lines",General,"Redfern rd Minto is a wide and safe street with footpaths down both sides. Why then is the actually driving area of the road so restricted and cluttered with obstacles? There are two separate bike paths running down the road to the station - the footpath is marked and signposted as a dedicated cycle lane so the addition of further unused cycle room on the actual road is unnecessary. The roundabouts which are supposed to maintain the flow of traffic are dangerous due to the amount of concrete and obstacles surrounding them. I have seen a couple of near misses there as the attention of drivers is focused on navigating their vehicle through the tight space into the roundabout and not on the roundabout itself, nor on the other traffic in or approaching the roundabout. The Kent st roundabout is particularly bad and I would suggest also not required for this quiet T intersection. The addition of a very aggressive bump in this already restricted and difficult to navigate piece of road takes further attention away from the traffic at the roundabout. This aggressive bump is a 'first gear' bump and further bottle-necks traffic flowing down the road. Traffic can now be backed up from the bump to the school and even the traffic lights, as each driver shifts down to first gear to get through this roundabout. Again, roundabouts are designed to maintain traffic flow. This roundabout is unnecessary and the obstacles around it are distracting and dangerous. The additional aggressive bump at the station is also unnecessary and a further distraction reducing the flow of traffic. The bump is right on the entry to a right angle bend at the station. Cars are already slowing down to second gear to go around the bend and the addition of a first gear bump into the bend is unnecessary, a distraction and dangerous. There is a lot of foot traffic at the station and further distractions in the form of this bump and the concrete bumper lanes are unsafe. One might also ask why the existing concrete median was torn up only to be re-laid the same week?"
69,1160,Graffiti at ICE,Graffiti,Nasty graffiti on side door at ICE
70,1168,Street light not working,General,Street light not working for a few months now.
71,1169,Major potholes damaging cars,General,Major potholes towards the end of the coniston close cul de sac - they have been there for years and make the road very difficult to drive on - would be wonderful if they could be repaired! Thank you.
72,117,Repainting lines at intersection,General,"Hi Please repaint intersection lines here as the old incorrect lines are as clear as the correct lines. This leads to some confusion as to who has right of way, and where cars can stop to see clearly when exiting Wallace St."
73,1170,Major potholes damaging cars,General,"There have been major potholes towards the end of the coniston close cul de sac for a long time now, making it very difficult to drive along. It would be great if these could be fixed! Thank you."

80,1185,Deep pothole on corner Emu Road and Rosamond Road,General,Deep pothole/road collapse - same thing again further west on Emu Road - about halfway along.
81,1186,Damaged road surface,General,Multiple potholes getting deeper as I type.
82,1187,Pothole,General,"Big pothole on westbound lane of Mowbray Road, right near the pedestrian refuge island. While traffic can drive around it under light conditions, a lot of vehicles are forced to drive through it during peak hours, risking damage to wheels & vehicles."
83,119,Pot holes at driveway,General,There are potholes developing at the start of 45 Sunny South Crescent's driveway. They are getting quite large.
84,1190,Pole Signage- fallen,General,"Hi, Please fix it"
85,1191,Traffic Congestion,General,"Due to there being a primary school in this street and only one feeder road in to the town from the west, getting out of Robin Street and heading into town on West High Street becomes an issue at school drop off and pick up times, there is also a pedestrian crossing around the corner at the top of the street and with the steady flow of traffic coming in from the west of the city, exiting the street becomes a lengthy experience. I believe there should be a set of traffic lights with pedestrian lights also at the top of the street to enable the safe passing of pupils/children/general public, and to allow the congestion from Robin Street to be dealt with by the functioning of the traffic lights."
86,1192,Speed in Street,General,"Due to the top of Robin Street having a round about and being slightly elevated, drivers speed down Robin Street with no regard for their own safety or that of children that could be playing in the street that houses a primary school. I believe speed humps would be a way of ensuring that speed was kept within a reasonable limit in this street that has seen a death in recent years on the only corner in the street in which the car was travelling from the roundabout end of Robin Street down to Gundagai Street. I believe the speed humps would be a great way of ensuring the safety of our younger generations in a prosperous school."
87,1194,Road Width,General,"In 2018 Council will be opening up the Frame Drive bridge to an open load limit for trucks where previously it was restricted. Many vehicles and trucks will use the adjoining Gingers Lane as a short cut to the Hart Rd on ramp for the new expressway. Gingers Lane is very narrow, has unfinished sections, no curb or guttering and no footpath for the children to walk on when the get off at the bus stop on Government Road."
88,1195,Storm Drains Blocked,General,Drains in this area are blocked up with paper cardboard and general rubbish including dust and gravel The council normally have this matter attended to each year .....But not this year !
89,1197,The road between Federal Highway and Morisset Road is extremely dangerous.,General,"This road (single lane in both directions) is full of pot holes which regularly appear, especially after rain. The road is in dreadful condition and is used as a bypass by heavy vehicles which travel far in excess of the speed limit. Over many years the dangerous conditions of the road have been regularly reported to TAMS who make no effort to improve the conditions."
90,1199,Dangerous traffic light,General,Crossing this traffic light is dangerous in two senses. First there is a forty centimetre curb which I have seen elderly people and children struggle with. Second the traffic light is set up so that cars turning left from Benson St onto High street goes green before the pedestrians have reached the middle island. On more than one occasion I have seen cars having to stop suddenly because they thought they had right of way and pedestrians where still legitimately crossing.
91,120,Weeds and Nails,General,"Along Giles Street in front of, and around, the Aspire Apartment complex (No.71), there are a number of trees along the sidewalks in garden beds. The garden beds are full of weeds and in some cases builders nails from the building work in nearby areas. The garden beds need to be weeded, more topsoil applied and mulch or ground cover for protection. I addition the area would benefit from some aesthetically appropriate bins for rubbish collection."
92,1200,Dangerous road crossing,General,Whenever I am at this location there are people crossing Sir Fred Schonell Drive. I estimate dozens of people cross this dual carriage way (with no central reservation) that divides a suburban neighbourhood. The nearest crossing for pedestrians is 80 to 100 metres away. Cars travel very fast down this road. It is a disaster waiting to happen.
93,1201,Street light in laneways not working,General,Street light that used to illuminate a walkway between Burraly Court and Marou Place in Ngunnawal is not working. This light has not operated for many months if not years.

100,1213,Pothole,General,Along Hopetoun Ave there are several patches of road damage but one pothole has become very deep and is getting worse.
101,1217,Hoons Speeding and Doing Burnouts Daily Lots of Kids in Street,General,"Mikkelsen Ave has become a haven for hoons speeding and even more criminal are the frequent burn-outs using the intersection of Mikkelsen and D'Urville. Tyre tracks of burn-outs are in-graved at this intersection and it is clearly visible and evident this happens alot. We suspect these hoons don't live to far away and is using this intersection as a test track frequently with different cars (they must have a hoon club or something. This is safety issue, not only are there burn-outs but dangerous speeding. Let me tell you about this street, there are so many young kids that if you walked passed you would think they are coming out of the drain. It's families with young kids in this street that deserve safety and peace and quite. You hear burn-outs at 11-12 at night, and after smell of burnt rubber that linkers, you hear babies cry. I propose the council set-up a roundabout and put speed humps in the streets concern."
102,1219,Hole in road,General,This large pothole might kill me if I hit it on my Motor scooter
103,1220,Pothole in road,General,A pothole has developed over the past few weeks in chapman parade outside number 5. It is gradually getting deeper.

107,1230,Graffiti,Graffiti,Graffiti on several buildings around here.
108,1231,Between Brimbin road & Old Lansdowne Road corners surfaceproblems,General,"Extremely rough, uneven surface which causes cars to violently rock side to side, throwing passengers around & causing drivers to try to miss such areas & drive mainly down the more-even surface in the middle of the road.With sharp corners each end of this strip, & with limited view of traffic, this practice is an accident waiting to happen. Council patches potholes & that is about all the attention that is given. Because Ms Machin knows this area I would love to show her just what I mean about the road & perhaps have her drive along the offending strip."
109,1233,Misuse of signage,General,"Brighton Ave is a high use carriageway that has both concealed driveways and crests. The council has decided to implement ""no stopping"" areas for the length of the avenue between Jarret St and Victory Parade. This distance is approximately 250 metres. They have erected 32 ""no stopping"" signs in this distance. Why did not the council use the standard of the unbroken yellow line along the kerb to delineate the area rather then create more risk by placing signs that both draw attention from the road but also increases risk to cyclists, pedestrians and motorists. Obviously less metal post mounted on the kerb would be safer, cheaper and less visual pollution."
110,1234,Mowing of grass around Casey market town,General,Hi can you please arrange to mow the grass around Casey market town. The grass at the roundabout off Clarrie Hermes drive onto kingsland parade the area that joins kingsland parade to Dalkin crescent and also dalkin crescent. It really lets the area down. Thank you

115,1239,Need for a stop sign,General,"The intersection of Greenfield Rd and Rickard Rd, Empire Bay, is in dire need of a STOP sign the slow traffic down as it nears the intersection. The 50 km speed limit is regularly flouted and a STOP sign will help reduce the risk of a collision. Also, there needs to be more signage and road painted speed signs to remind motorists of the speed limit."

120,1245,Major highway needs updating,General,Central coast highway kariong hill is a major highway. Has major traffic in both directions and is bumper to bumper during peak hours. Needs to be updated to use as a motorway not an old outdated highway with little traffic. There are no safety signs if breakdown or accident on the hill until we are literally on top of the accident. and we see children and bike riders taking lives into danger getting up and down the hill
121,1246,Streetlights constantly on,General,The streetlights in the section of Athlon Drive at Beasley Street have been on constantly for well over a month.
122,1247,Potholes,General,Potholes as you turn into Airlie Street. Lightly repaired each time it rains but need to be fully repaired with new hotmix road base as has been done in other areas of this street.
123,1248,Line Marking Required,General,"Sharp turn on Aberfeldy Crescent near Hebridges Place, creates a blind spot driving in both directions. As there is no line marking in the middle vehicles tend to drive in the middle of the road. I have seen a few near-miss incidents of head on collusion."
124,1249,"Over 10,000 cars, trucks and buses use this one way, four metre wide, residential street every day. RMS maximum recommendation is 2000 cars per day. This is getting worse.",General,"Mary St, St Peters is a single lane, one way street between the Princes Highway and Unwins Bridge Road St Peters. Since the development of IKEA and the light industrial site in Mary St we residents have been inundated with cars, buses and trucks. With the opening of hundreds of apartments in Ricketty St there will be hundreds of vehicles more as this is the only access to go west to the Metro Shjopping Centre etc. The Council needs to look at the impact of all related developments in the area when allowing development applications. Mary St must be the most abused road in Australia."
125,125,Access right turn out of the street,General,Access from lower MacMillan Street is difficult and lengthy at times. Aroundabout at nearby Brady's Corner on Frenchs Forest Road would ease the problem.
126,1251,Noisy metal plate,General,There is a square metal plate covering something (not sure what) on the road in front of our house. When cars drive over it there is a loud noise as the plate moves. I would love the plate to be re-seated so that it is no longer noisy when driven over.

130,1258,Pedestrian Crossing needs repair,General,The pedestrian crossing on Duke Street (near Evaline Street) is in very very poor condition and I am in appalled that the council has not maintained this. Paint is not that expensive surely. I have used this crossing many times and most cars won't stop because they don't see the Zebras markings on the speed hump. Also where is the bright pedestrian light overhead for night visibility? Could you please fix this as someone is going to get killed if nothing is done soon. Thank you for reading this.
131,126,Deplorable state of Tinderry Road,General,"As you well know, this road is full of pot holes and corrugations. The low level crossing at Michelago Creek is in appalling condition and has been for years yet nothing done to rectify it bar spreading a bit of gravel over the top to cover the exposed reo. The first decent rain washed that away. There are pot holes in the cement of the crossing and the approach either side is dangerous. The first 4 km of this road is beyond just grading. There are areas where you cannot avoid pot holes as they are from one side of the road to the other. Most of the sheeting gravel had been pushed to the sides of the road which means the main vehicle path is down to bed rock. This road needs more work that just simply grading the gravel back onto the road as if that is all that is done, the road will deteriorate rapidly again. There are a lot of trucks using this road as well as local traffic yet it does not receive very much attention at all. Grading it once a year is not good enough. There are no guide posts on this section of road. The take off drains in some spots go up hill."
132,1260,Advertising sign obstructing footpath and pedestrian crossing,General,"Archer Hotel, 60 O'Connell Street, North Adelaide. Seems to happen most evenings and late afternoon.

137,1269,Boat on trailer parked on Queen Street opposite Arlinton Street,General,"A trailer boat has been parked for several weeks and prior to that a car, at the top of the T intersection where Arlington Street meets Queens Road. Queens Road is a major thoroughfare carrying traffic to the City West Link. Arlington Street carries traffic from Queens St to Parramatta Road and Croydon Road. The vehicles are parked in such a way as to prevent through traffic passing vehicles turning right into Arlington Street, with a consequence that a considerable traffic jam can be caused by one vehicle turning right into Arlington Street. I have held mu licence for 50 years and seems to remember that at one state it was illegal to park at the top of a T intersection in any way that blocked through traffic from passing a vehicle making a right hand turn."

147,128,Damaged Road Surface,General,"This street has had no work done on it in the 24 yeasr I have lived here. it is showing serious surface damage due to use, mostly by large trucks involved in redevelopment of properties in the street (Duplexes). While there may not be anything that can be done, the street is also very narrow and the aforementioned redevelopments have resulted in more cars being parked in the street. The street would benefit from the creation of parking bays into the nature strip and this may be less costly if incorporated into any repairs."

As they speed past my house, this jumping motion generates very loud and disturbing sound continuously due to non stop heavy traffic. Thanking you in advance for considering my problem."
252,184,Road construction,General,No one is working since January. Barricade every where. Just want to know when this project will be finished.
253,189,Abandoned trailer ( not registered),General,The trailer has been there for about a month. It is parked dangerously.
254,19,Weeds on footpath out of control,General,Weeds are growing waist-high on the footpath at the end of Church street (growing through the cracks in the asphalt).
255,191,Surface on sides on road,General,"Because the street has no guttering, and only dirt and gravel on the sides of the road. Whenever it rains the dirt gets washed away and the gravel often gets washed across the road causing a hazzard. Also the erosion is starting to cause hazzards from driveways with the levels getting lower and lower from the property height"
256,192,Surface of Sutton Road breaking up,General,Sutton road Ashcroft is a very well traveled road with buses and heavy trucks using this road every day. I have seen side streets being patched; another mess but this main road has had no attention for at lest 25 years. It needs a total resurface as the existing surface is cracking up and the under-base can be seen coming through the cracks as a cray sludge.
257,193,Dangerous corner,General,I am always wary driving down Grosvenor Rd on my way to work in the morning because of the near misses I have seen. There is a blind corner and sometimes the traffic is backed up the road. Cars and trucks fly around the corner then have to slam on the brakes as they come upon a line of cars not moving. One day late last year I was sitting there and a truck came tearing down the road towards my stationary car. I had nothing to do except edge my car forward a little. The poor truck went onto the other side of the road (thankfully nothing was coming the opposite direction) to stop plowing into the back of me (and causing a multi car pile up).
258,195,Street Light,General,Street light not working
259,197,Motorcycle parking,General,"With the increase in the number of cafes and retail stores in this precinct, along with the number of people taking up motorcycle and scooter riding, there is an urgent need in this area to establish parking facilities specific for motorcycle and scooters. There is sufficient space between the last demarcated car space and the traffic lights to establish some bays."
260,198,Road Damage (Pot holes and wash outs),General,Council works were carried out on the road last year and no resurfacing done. With all the rain and heavy transport (sheep and cattle trucks) the dirt fill ins and existing pot holes have gotten larger. Perhaps some fill in could be done.
261,199,"Too many potholes, uneven surface",General,Needs to bo completely re surfaced along the road from about Eastern Av to Tarro Pub
262,20,Significant number of large potholes,General,This section of Bayview st near Warners Bay rd had a large number of very big pot holes continually
263,201,Stormwater,General,"During persistent or heavy rain, storm water running down the street will then continue down our driveway often bringing topsoil and gravel which will clog up our drains and cause flooding."
264,204,Fix the street,General,Ives Avenue also needs a pavement for pedestrian walking. it is dangerous to cross or walk the street with baby strollers. too many times i have been honked or shouted by drivers because im sharing the road with the motorists. appreciate if this can be provided as the road is busy during the day time.
265,206,Speeding in side street 50km/h zone,General,"Hitchcock st provides a shortcut between St Albans Rd and Fellmongers Rd. This shortcut is used by students of the Gordon Tafe and people travelling home in the afternoons as a way of avoiding the fellmongers rd and boundary rd round about which gets extremely congested from 3:30pm - 5:30pm weekdays. All day, every day people speed down this street. There are lots of families with young children in the street, it’s only a matter of time before the inevitable happens. I have been in the street 3 years and already I’ve seen 4 cars lose control on the corner halfway down Hitchcock st, 3 of which ended up in someone’s front yard."
266,207,Speeding in side street 50km/h zone,General,"Hitchcock st provides a shortcut between St Albans Rd and Fellmongers Rd. This shortcut is used by students of the Gordon Tafe and people travelling home in the afternoons as a way of avoiding the fellmongers rd and boundary rd round about which gets extremely congested from 3:30pm - 5:30pm weekdays. All day, every day people speed down this street. There are lots of families with young children in the street, it’s only a matter of time before the inevitable happens. I have been in the street 3 years and already I’ve seen 4 cars lose control on the corner halfway down Hitchcock st, 3 of which ended up in someone’s front yard."
267,209,"Intersection of Flowers Dr and Pacific Hwy, Catherine a Hill Bay",General,"For 2 decades I've lived here and seen our Progress Assoc do everything it can to see this intersection improved. Surveys, guest speakers - Councillors, research consultants, MPs. Nothing. Accidents continue. They all seem to just wait for a developer to pay. At least put 1 Speed Camera Ahead sign north of the intersection. Over the time my son was born and is now driving to uni every day, not quite awake, rushing to get a park there. I live in dread."
268,21,Blocked storm water drain,General,The storm water drain has been blocked for over three years now. Every time it rains 1/3 of the street floods in that area causing a major risk to passing traffic. This is even more of a safety concern as it is right beside a child care centre. The drain is in front of 56 Camden street
269,210,"Problems with Gertrude Street, North Gosford",General,"Pot holes, crumbling road surfaces, lack of proper K&G, never-ending littering, speeding in a high density housing area (increasingly so, with the influx of low rental accommodation in the area), motorists ""dodging"" police presence in Mann Street and Henry Parry Drive, when moving between ""watering holes"" in CBD & Wyoming & illegal parking , and neither GCC, nor Police, seem concerned. All of this, between 2 T-intersections, one each side of an almost ""blind"" crest, makes one wonder that both authorities, will, seemingly, only finally respond when the inevitable fatality, or serious accident occurs. Past representations to GCC to install some form of traffic taming device in the most dangerous section of the street, between Ormond & Etna Streets, met with virtual ridicule, I'm sorry to say."
270,218,Nathan Rogers Test Subject,General,Nathan Rogers Test Details
271,219,Unsafe Road,General,Tregeagle Road is constantly full of potholes which occur every time it rains and are only filled with rubble that washes away at the first sprinkle. Also large trucks and double B's drive along this road and cause havoc as they drive in the middle of the road which is has too many unsafe corners. How about some lines down the middle of the road or at least fix the pot holes permanently.
272,22,Raised bision impaired pedestrian tile,General,Lifting tile creating trip hazard
273,220,Bumpy and uneven road surface,General,Brooms Head Road up the hill from River Street is bumpy and uneven causing people to take very strang lines up the hill. On occasions drivers have slowed so much that others have attempted to overtake only to have the slower vehicle change direction and speed up as they pass teh rough section. A resurfacing would make this a more predictable place to drive.
274,221,Wapengo Lake RD,General,"Drainage problems continue to make road impassible after less than 1"" of rain. The first hundred metres of the road needs drainage to prevent the existing 30cm deep rut across the road reoccurring. Also further along the road up to the culvert all the drains are blocked so when it rains the water backs up right across the width of the road at the drains."
275,223,Lack of rain water drainage,General,Lack of rainwater drainage from the hill and roadways causing flash flooding during rain events.
276,224,"Speed signs, No speed Humps, and no paved sidewalks",General,"There is no pavements on the side walks, and people especially young children walk in the middle of the road. There are no speed limits on the main roads or the adjacent streets, and cars just speed up especially in Trevor Housley Avenue where there is no way to go. Some people dump rubbish as well and if it is a windy day we all get the rubbish in our lawns."
277,225,"A very ""bouncy Cessnock Rd",General,"Between Maitland and Cliftleigh, the road is so badly surfaced it is nearly impossible to keep the car on the road, extra traffic to the New Hunter Expressway has exacerbated an already broken down surface, ruts, crippled edges, potholes and uneven tar , only a matter of time before a speeding vehicle causes a head on because a rut threw the car to the wrong side."
278,23,Street light not working,General,Light not on
279,230,Street light out,General,"Street light is out outside 27 Ripple Crescent, The Ponds"
280,232,No road markings,General,"The intersections of Burns Road, Cleveland Street and Grosvenor Street in Wahroonga are not marked appropriately. The priority road goes from Cleveland through to Grosevenor with the two Burns Road intersections having Stop signs. However the council refuses to put line markings on this strange road layout. Thus people proceeding along Cleveland Street from Wahroonga turn turn across traffic from Grosvenor as they believe they have right of way - yet Burns road has a stop sign (ie it is the secondary road). Local drivers adopt the practise of stopping at the junction with Burns road and pretend there is a give way sign. The council should either mark the road with white lines to show the correct priority flow or put in a roundabout. The council has marked the roads approaching this interchange with white lines and has put in a new roundabout at Stuart Street but refuses to sort out this bizarre piece of road. Sooner or later there will be a nasty accidence."
281,233,Frame drive bridge,General,"Council changed limit on the bridge and to reinforce this they placed concrete barriers on either side to limit the size of vehicle that can past. The bus on its usual route scraped either side of the bus trying to fit though. The flow of traffic has slowed enormously. With frustrated drivers. One witnessed jumping the queue by three cars in front of him. Lights have now been added, only slowing traffic even more. The council also added more dirt and compacted it in the river bed. This was to allow the local school children to walk or ride through the river bed to get to and from school. This is an accident waiting to happen. Cessnock council has just made a huge problem out of a minor one."
282,234,Animal & people abuse,General,"Even though we have a lot of animals & they're a lot of people who take it in their hands try to get of them without council approval & believe some were slaughtered on our property even if we have a disability, it's believed they like hurting even if we get rid of the animals we're still targets for abuse we've told the police & the rspca & they've done nothing at all as if they're supporting it. the council should take authority over the rspca because we also believe that there are other people who may have a lot of animals & may or may not have a disability & don't have a farm are left alone & may have friends to help to either steal or slaughter other pets so no-one will know. We also have neighbour who suffers from strokes, drives a car, starts gossiping about things & watches porn videos & even if the neighbours knows about it, they do nothing about it as they're friends with him & they're others like us are copping similar problems to us. Also you should look into how some companies who are providing mobility equipment to the disabled as they maybe faulty and if the disabled want to put themselves way in credit to buy expensive equipment the company seems to think they've got the right to stop them from over crediting without asking the person in question first before doing it."
283,235,Hart Road Expressway exit,General,"Due to increased traffic at the intersection of Hart Road, Sawyers Gully Road and Gingers Lane, we have seen many accidents occur since the opening of the expressway, it is only a matter of time till we see a major accident happen. Due to increase traffic and poor visibility of traffic coming around the bends. A roundabout would help the flow of traffic and help avoid future accidents."
284,236,Broken/Missing grates over drain,General,There are several missing/broken grates in the drain along the pathway.
285,237,Pothole at traffic light,General,Pothole right on traffic light line. In Westbound queue second lane turning left
286,24,Pot hole,General,Fix pot hole test
287,240,Corner of Parry Street and Riviera Avenue,General,"The corner out of Parry Street, turning right into Riviera Ave can be hazardous when other traffic is nearby. Secondly, Council has recently ungraded half! of Parry St., but the remainder remains without a footpath, etc.. This is potentially dangerous for pedestrians, including young school children, who have to walk on a potholed and battered road that is frequently used by cars and trucks."
288,246,Swings,General,The problem is located at The Holt Community Park. It is in the Children's play area. The ground underneath the swing needs to be built up so little kids can climb onto the swing.
289,247,Path edgeing,General,The problem is located at The Holt community Park. Grass is growing across the circular path. The path needs to be trimmed with an edger.
290,248,Road,General,England ave has pot holes in maybe 4 spots and large also there is very poor lighting in the street at night
291,249,Broken Surface,General,The surface of Tasman Close from about half way up the street to the end has broken up and exposed many areas of the base as well as the sublayer. The street needs to be resurfaced.
292,25,Street lights,General,The lights need a shroud so that I can get to sleep please.
293,250,Buchanan Rd Rebuild,General,This road has been neglected for years and now that it takes more traffic because of its connection to the Hunter Expressway it is much worse and nothing is being done to improve it
294,251,"Narrow, winding road with crumbling edges",General,"George Downes Drive at Kulnura is a narrow tourist road on route between Sydney and the Hunter Valley. It is a popular road frequented by cars, trucks, bicycles and cars. Council and State Government have been asked to upgrade the road as there have been accidents and deaths. The response is that now they are going to lower the speed limit. Speed has not always been the cause of these accidents, avoiding potholes has been a factor. Fix the road don't reduce the speed to 80km and 60km on this country road."
295,253,Repair works needed,General,When it rains heavily the corner of Cleveland St and Anzac Parade floods. This makes it difficult for cars to be driven safely and impedes traffic flow.
296,254,Repairs needed,General,During heavy rain the street floods and water seeps into the business on the corner. Does not appear that stormwater drainage is adequate.
297,255,Tonga Park,General,Tonga Park has been reported by community members to have very poor lighting at night. It is believed that walking through this park is very dangerous at night as people under the influence seem to be in this dimly light park.
298,256,Missing painted arrows,General,"There are two lanes where a car can turn left or right out of Gloucester street bonnyrigg heights onto Cowpasture Road. However, there are no painted arrows on the road to indicate which lane is right turn only or left hand only. As such there is often a number of cases where cars have had near misses or there has been a bit of road rage. If arrows could be painted onto the road that would be appreciated."
299,258,Disgusting road,General,"Pot holes, uneven grading,unfinished work,Heavy Loaded Trucks using rd on daily basis"
300,263,Missing Telstra pit lid,Footpaths,Lid is missing / cracked on traffic island. Hazard to traffic and pedestrians
301,264,Damaged road surface,General,"There is an enormous squashed-in hole. Quite a while ago the road was re-tarred then sprinkled with gravel, leaving it quite soft and sticky, and the next time the garbage truck collected the bins the weight of the vehicle stopped in that spot gouged the big hole into the road."
302,265,Lakes way rainbow flat,General,Appalling damaged road surface on a serious corner
303,266,Road needs resurfacing and 2nd footpath needs to be established,General,The potholes in the road get only patched up and after a week or so they are back again.
304,268,Condition of Deasys Rd Rothbury,General,The east end of Deasys's Rd is in very poor condition and has been for a number of years. It is full of pot holes and the edges of the road are giving way and are all over the place. (Warping). The north end of McDonalds Rd Rothbury is also in need of repair. One section has sunk while another section on the bend is full of potholes.
305,269,Exposed cable on power pole,General,There is a power pole in front of number 35 when an exposed cable. There is a cover over the cable that has been damaged and left the cable exposed at around waist hight.
306,27,Pot hole,General,Since the rain just before the flood a couple of weeks ago a pot hole has developed at the intersection of Deighton Rd and Gladstone Rd - lots of gravel coming away from it and cars' tyres spinning on it.
307,270,Tunnel not working,General,Having trouble accessing the tunnel. When is it supposed to be accessable
308,272,Street needing resurfacing,General,The Street has big holes around the gutters and extremely loose gravel. The street needs resurfacing and probably a street sweeper giving it a good clean. This may help with the loose gravel.
309,273,Damage to the road service,General,There is currently 3 big hole there cancuile did turn up last time after alot of complain but they just fill the holls up they clearely need to be cutt of and redone again
310,274,No Street lights between 86 -92 northumberland rd 2144,General,There has been no street lights between 86-92 northumberland rd auburn nsw 2144 for several days. It seems the light bulbs need replacing as all the street lights are working. Please check it out ASAP.

313,279,ACT Government car park,General,"Unsealed dirt parking, uneven surface with numerous bumps and large potholes (one immediately at carpark entry), soil erosion and boggy when wet."
314,28,Gas leak,General,"In the street outside the property line of 34 Auburn Ave. Due to the system of ""private gas providers"" reports normally go via the householder to their retail provider. But this leak is on the street, somewhere - it is smelled by passers by and NOT by the householder. We have been unable to find out which agency is responsible for the gas lines in the street"
315,280,Blocked lane,General,At intersection of Vale and miller Street cars can turn right into Vale Street and park in the left hand lane. This means through traffic is entirely blocked whenever someone turns right. Has becone much worse in the last year with more parking for Cammeray public school
316,281,Pot holes,General,Pot holes exist for Coonanbarra Rd in the North bound lane. As soon as you turn into Coonanbarra Rd from the Pacific Hwy there are numerous pot holes. The road is in a desprite need of repairs before a Motorcyclist's tyres get caught and throws the rider/s off.
317,284,Unsafe and unsuitable parking area,General,"The ACT Government is responsible for the alternate car parking area, at Bonython Primary School, and needs to be made aware of the unsafe and unsuitable condition that this area is currently in. This includes:"
318,285,Pot holes,Pothole,Large pot holes near gutter on eastern side of intersection for westbound traffic.
319,286,Showground Rd,General,Entire Road requires resurfacing
320,287,Pedestrians crossing inappropriatly,Road Signs,There are signs telling pedestrians to cross at the lights on the western corner of Cowper St ( opposite the Mantra) & also on the eastern side of Valentine steer facing toward Cowper St. Since the opening of the new Atria apartment building there has been a significant increase in the number of pedestrians crossing from Cowper St to Valentine st. This creating safety issues when drivers are trying to turn right out of Cowper into Parkes St which is difficult enough as it is. I know a sign won't stop this problem but might alleviate it. Also there is a problem with the signage for parking outside 33-35 Cowper St driveway leading to people parking across said driveway.as the sign does not indicate parking is not allowed across the driveway.
321,288,Car Park issue,General,"Large pot holes, uneven surface, holes are getting bigger."
322,289,Concrete broken away on gutter,General,On the corner of 13th avenue and cypress terrace the concrete gutter is broken
323,29,Unsafe surface,General,Large pressure ridges in centre lane on the corner apex major steering issues fro motorcycles
324,291,Bad road surface,General,Pot hole in entrance to Lethbridge park shops behind the garage .. Corner Apia place and Bougainville rd. It is over half the entrance and was filled once before but is alot bigger this time.
325,292,Bad road surface,General,"Where the bridge is for the overpass near Lethbridge park primary school and shops the road surface has two pot holes not that far apart. Going twists copeland road on left hand side,"
326,294,Potholes,General,This section of Wallalong Crescent has deteriorated badly and is strewn with potholes and corrugation making the driving unsafe at times.
327,295,Road Surface,General,"Redbill Drive from Lawson Ave to Woodberry Road needs to be completely torn up and redone. Every time it rains, council come around to fill the holes only to be emptied again the next time it rains. The road surface is irregular, in fact, from about Eagle Close to Lawson Ave, you have to drive on the opposite side of the road to avoid the mole hills. The end of Redbill Drive at Woodberry Road is like swiss cheese."
328,297,More than ten pot holes,General,"Blue Ridge Drive, White Rock is riddled with pot holes and when a vehicle coming in the opposite directions approaches you are forced to drive over multiple pot holes."
329,299,Two growing potholes,General,"Two potholes that are rapidly expanding with large chunks of loose bitumen, not far from bus stop"
330,30,Road gutters and drains,General,"The end of Groningen road is dirt road with no gutter or drainage system and no footpaths. it is dangerous especially after heavy rain. The road needs sealing, footpaths & a proper drainage system"
331,300,Confusing traffic flow at intersection,Road Signs,"It is unclear at the Ferndell st traffic lights whether the two lanes of traffic can turn right onto Clyde st. Typically the left lane turns left onto Rawson rd and right lane turns left to Clyde st., which is the safest flow of traffic. However as there are no road signs or arrow markings on road, there are cases of cars turning right onto Clyde st from the left hand lane, who then immediately want to turn right on Wellington. This catches drivers unawares, cuts across traffic and causes merging issues. I have seen and experienced multiple near miss accidents here, as the drivers in right lane do not except someone to be undertaking from the left and then have them immediately turn right. If there were clear arrows marking the direction of turning on ferndell st, this problem would be solved. With left hand traffic only allowed left, and right lane traffic only allowed right."
332,301,Turn left on red sign required.,General,When turning left from Eurobin Avenue onto Pittwater Road I think it would be appropriate to have a 'turn left on red' sign. There is very good vision to the right to judge oncoming traffic for at least 200m. And the light cycle is understandably quite long.
333,302,Long queue in left lane,Road Signs,Darcy road into cumberland highway has two lanes; the right lane for right turn only. The left lane is used by all other traffic. Creates very long queues and delays during the daytime. Very small traffic using the right lane.
334,304,Pothole,General,Pothole just before roundabout
335,306,Bumps developed in road on corner,General,"Road is bumpy making the corner unsafe, cars need to slow significantly to take the corner, more than usual. this makes cars following come dangerously close to the rear as they are not expecting the car to slow down as much to take the corner."
336,308,23 plus potholes,General,There are roughly 23 potholes along Turramurra Ave from the Pacific Highway to the intersection with Boomerang St. These have become bigger since the recent rain. I understand that council doesn't want to resurface this road as the area is earmarked for further development. However given the state of the road I believe some remediation to patch these holes should be made for the council ratepayers that live around and use this road.
337,31,Excessive speeding,General,Cars speed along this road 24 hours a day. Use of speed bumps similar to Clarkson would be very nice.
338,313,Pot hole,General,Very large pot hole causing flat front passenger tyre. Another car behind me also got flat tyre. Both cars fixed by NRMA. Time of incident 6.15am 9/9/14
339,316,Road needs resurfacing,General,The road is getting very potholed and uneven at the intersection and needs to be redone
340,318,Test,General,This is just a test submission as we want to learn more about fixmystreet
341,319,Cars Racing on This Road,General,On weekends in the evening/ night hours there are cars racing up and down this section of the road. Please put a patrol or a speed camera.
342,320,Crossing,General,Many school kids either alone or with their parents cross this every morning and afternoon. Cars continue to drive faster than the speed limit and dangerous for those crossing the street. A crossing would benefit many pedestrians and hopefully also decrease cars speed.
343,321,Pot holes and Brocken edges of carriageway?,General,"The street is a throw back to the 1950,s and carries a large volume of traffic,especially in peak hours,school hours.and an embarrassment outside of the entrance to Rooty Hill R.S.L."
344,326,Radius of curve,General,This corner has a decreasing radius when coming from The Coast Road. There was a fatality this year on this bend. The corner needs to be redesigned so it has a constant radius.
345,330,Pothole,General,Recent pothole covered but opening up again
346,332,Pothole,Pothole,A pothole has developed right in the path of wheels
347,333,Road surface,General,The entire length of the bitumen section is patched to the point of being dangerously rough and uneven. Sections are comstantly falling away on the edges causing traffic to drive in the centre of the road. The gravel section has huge potholes and some corrugations. In places these also cause traffic to take evasive acrion and drive on the wrong side of the road.
348,334,Pothole on the road,General,There is a big pothole which is a hazard to all vehicles travelling from Doonside road (approaching from the Grt Western hwy) towards Bungaribee road Please fix ASAP
349,335,Graffiti on footpath,General,"The footpath has recently been replaced on the corner outside 9 Gerald Crescent. About one week ago, someone has spray painted graffiti on the footpath."
350,336,Poor lighting which is dangerous to pedestrians,General,"The side driveway to my block of units has no light on the street, making it very dangerous at night time pulling into the driveway because you cannot see any pedestrians and parked cars on the street add to this difficulty. It is particularly a problem in Winter when children are still walking on the street after 5.30pm when it is dark"
351,337,Dangerous driving,General,"Guildford road is a haven for fast drivers, it is constantly barraged at night by street racers, causing immediate concern to the families that live in the area, whilst constant and busy during the day it is at night when all the illegal driving occurs, many times I have seen near misses, many times are people blocking the street, speed bumps are needed on this lengthy street to slow drivers down. There is a large family community in the area of an average of 3 children per family."
352,338,Graffiti on location post and road,General,As well as graffiti on both sides of the Great Western Highway Minchinbury (already reported) there is graffiti on the location post on the side of the road.
353,339,Fix our road,General,"The street we reside on is quite long 1100 meters with 5 speed hump & legally zoned as a 4 tonne load limit, with many large trucks & motorbikes using this street, potholes are a regular issue, not to mention the inadequate positioning & worn speed humps, FIX OUR STREET"
354,343,Pothole,General,Pothole out on road adjacent to driveway. We have to swerve or straddle pothole to avoid damaging tyres which increases chance of accident w on coming vehicles as there is a 100km sign approx 100m before.
355,346,Speeding danger - urgent,General,Sunset Boulevarde is situated on a steep hill and motorists use the street as a short cut to Newcastle University. Students are often running late and speed down this street quite recklessly and at very high speeds although it is designated as a 50 zone. I suggest a couple of speed similar to those in Janet street bumps be installed in order to slow things down before a serious accident occurs
356,347,"Nimala Avenue, Koolewong",General,"This road is a disgrace it urgently needs attention. It is too narrow, has numerous potholes and broken pavement. Is difficult to turn around due to parked cars, caravans etc in the turning circle, & to access the private ramp to house numbers 29, 31, 33. We are trying to sell land @ 29 and interested parties are appalled at the state of the road. When will it get attention?"
357,348,Goat track called a road,General,"The bucketts way between taree and Gloucester is a disgrace for a main road nothing has been done for a long time to fix this road. this is a school bus route, you cannot hear youself because of the condition of road."
358,349,Speeding Drivers,General,Cars constantly go faster then 50kms/hr. There should be speed humps to slow them down ... particularly as there is a school at the end of the street.
359,35,Hole in nature strip & graffiti,General,"Hi, there is a small but deepish hole dug out in the grass/nature strip near the electric pole outside number 19 Blackshaws road Newport (on the side/south of the road near curb). Myself (carrying my baby) and my 4yr old have twisted our ankles getting in and out of our car a couple of times as its right where you need to stand to get in and/or adjust kids carseat etc. if it could be filled in that would be great? Also the electrical pole next to it has black graffiti on it too, would be good if this could be removed? Thanks."
360,350,Dangerous intersection,General,"There should be a roundabout on the corner of Childs st and John St Lidcombe. When turning right from Childs st into John st, visibility is very poor due to parked cars in John st. A roundabout here would go a long way towards resolving the problem."
361,352,Illegally Parked Vehicles,General,I have given up trying to catch the bus here due to the Bus Stop being parked out by illegally parked vehicles. They park on the nature strip and on the footpath also. The nature strip is now dirt.

362,354,Stupid Signage,Road Signs,"There is a new ""Safety Camera"" on Victoria Road. The speed limit on Victoria Road is 70.

Secondly, there are so many signs that they tend to hide each other as well as the traffic lights at the intersection."

Heavy vehicle traffic has caused degradation of the road surface to the point where there is no water run-off. Large potholes (the one pictured is almost a metre across & 20cm deep) keep reforming as patching is ineffective. Being a tourist destination, there is an increase in activity in warmer months & the road is a severe hazard to traffic as well as to the many children frequenting the area & riding bicycles. Over the years, I have observed (& gone to the aid of) several cyclists who have suffered injuries as a direct result of the condition of the road surface."
364,36,"Rubbish, glass & graffiti",General,"Hi, there is glass, rubbish and ugly graffiti along the road in the grassy area (particularily on east side of road) on the side walls and under the underpass. As there is no concrete path on that side if we approach walking from the south east with my kids and I (with buggy) have to walk along the grass.

Even our 14yr old son came home one day telling us he almost gone run over whilst crossing there. Part of the problem appears to be that drivers, whilst heading west, are allowing their vehicles to speed up (over the speed limit) as they come down the hill on the approach to the crossing. It's very dangerous and it will probably only be a matter of time before someone gets injured or killed there."

I stood my ground, he swerved around me and I said I would report this incident to the council, and he would possibly be fined. He then roared thru the bushland, drove off and turned into pagneil crt. 2 problems I believe have recently arisen. The main one is the fire break grader has opened up an access to the west of the main entry area to Manning Park, Cnr davilak and Janson road, therefore now allowing a new access to the bushland.

431,458,New Traffic Islands a Hindrance,General,"Last week, new concrete traffic islands were installed on the left side of Power street just before the intersection with Knox road. This means that traffic is forced into banking up in one lane instead of two. Whereas previously the traffic would bank up in two lanes up to about Crawford road, because of these traffic islands, the traffic is forced into banking up in one lane and banks up way back up the street to as far as Crawford Public School. This is made worse by the fact that the traffic light sequencing gives traffic in Power street heading west the shortest possible time to go so only 4-5 cars get to go through the green light before it changes again. This intersection is a nightmare of a morning and is also made worse by a dedicated right turn lane which is unnecessary as the majority of traffic goes straight ahead or turns left. The structure of this intersection, the traffic light sequencing and now the new traffic islands all work towards making this intersection a major traffic nightmare and council needs to rethink it completely!"

The location they were moved from was not properly treated, so the road surface has dropped causing the problem. There has been a considerable increase in the volume and size of vehicular traffic over the past couple of years, and the noise of trucks hitting the pothole is deafening, particularly large empty trucks with trailers, and also,timber trucks . We feel the vibrations through our home. Council did a good job of stopping water from the road entering our property last year, and I thought they were/are aware of this problem, as water fills the hole and then is dispersed our way when traffic goes through it.

The cost of land rates and land tax in the area are not recipricated with keeping the concept of Forde as it should be, an open and park like environment that encourages people to move in and around the area. The place has gone to the dogs."

509,588,Speeding Cars on residential road,General,"Numerous cars come around the corner from Diggers Beach Road and ""Plant it"" resulting in skidding, particularly in the wet, fishtailing etc and as it is a down hill straight ,speeding down the street. This is a residential area with many residents crossing Firman Drive to get to the beach. There is a resort on one side of the road with numerous cars, parked outside the resort as well as coaches and mini buses. These cars are going in and out of the carpark at all times during the day. There have been many near misses and this is an area waiting for a disaster. It seems that this road is a well known spot if you want to ""hoon"" as the speeding activity has increased in recent years. Apart from the noise these cars make with their noisy engines, skidding tyres etc . The speeding cars can still be heard as they speed around to Charlesworth Bay road. I would think that traffic calmers would fix this problem. This is a dangerous situation. there are 5 driveways into AAnuka Beach Resort and three cross streets as well as numerous local residents walking across the road at various spots along the road to get to the beach. I was recently seeing my family off from my home and as my son was strapping his children into their seatbelts a car came around the corner , lost traction in the wet , fishtailed for a distance , towards my son's car and did a 180 degree spin with car facing in opposite direction when he came to a halt.

513,591,Graffiti & Dumped Goods,General,Power sub station with graffiti and dumped household goods eg TV.
514,592,Street parking,General,Morotai road is not very wide. Residents have in the past parked on the nature strips in front of their houses. Recently the police booked all the cars parked on the nature strip. Morotai road is a major thoroughfare to other streets in Revesby height as well as the 926 bus route. Since the police have booked people for parking on the nature strip a number of cars parked in the street have have side mirrors broken by passing vehicles. In addition when cars are parked on either side of the street there is quite often a line of up to 6 cars trying to pass along the street. This causes problems for people trying to reverse out of their driveways. This is particularly problematic given that we have a high number of elderly drivers living in the street. I would suggest that council construct tiled parking areas on the nature strips similar to what exist in sans souci such as in Bonney street. ( see Google street view for details)

518,602,Stormwater drainage,General,"Property flooding due to inadequate stormwater drainage. Woniora Road No.s 250, 252 and 254 are regularly flooded during heavy rain. Problem 1: Woniora Road at this location is a low point, catching water from King Georges Rd via Cheddar St, Taunton St, and Blakesley Rd. Problem 2: not enough street openings to the drain. Problem 3: Traffic speeds through creating waves, increasing water flow onto No.s 250 and 252. Problem 4: Collection bins are put in front of drains by neighbours across the road. Council has checked and says the drainage system is clear so the problem is not enough openings to the stormwater drainage system."
519,604,No overtaking lane for 37kms west bound on Kings Highway,General,"Travelling West on Kings Highway, there is no overtaking lane from the top of the Clyde Mountain for 37kms (until just over the Shoalhaven River). This is an incredibly busy road and no overtaking lane for 37 kms is a recipe for disaster. There are in the area travelling East."
520,605,State of Road,General,"Uneven road surface, pot holes and road trenches that have not been filled in properly. These issues have been constant from the new industrial area at Marsden Park right up to where the old golf course and driving range used to be for the past 2 years. I have been in contact with RMS over and over again to no avail. It has gotten to the point where I couldn't live with the daily drive in my car with a sports tuned suspension and have traded to a 4wd to somewhat cope with the poor road conditions. I understand there is road works, but the road should be in a minimum condition that is not unsafe and cause damage to vehicles that have to use the road. Hopefully you can help. My next step is to approach the media."
521,606,Racing and Illegal Parking,General,"Due to speed cameras on Edgar st, this quiet street has now become a proxy for a link to the Hume highway. Also racing is becoming problematic day and night with footpaths unusable due to illegal parking it is highly dangerous to walk around. Two kids were nearly run over recently from cars going over 80km/hr. Plus a major high speed accident at glassop street intersection involving police and fire dept. A high value quiet street is becoming a hoon's playground due to lack of any traffic management and elderly are unable to walk around. Closing the street off at Marion st would eliminate high speed racing down the hill to time the lights at the highway plus fining illegal parkers. I will also be sending details to the local paper to ensure council takes note and doesn't ignore this."
522,607,Street light out,General,The street light in front of 6 clyde finlay street Macgregor has been out for over a week can you please fix it

529,614,Long grass and weeds,General,"The whole of the area around Aranda ,Cook and the Jamison centre is an absolute disgrace ,with long grass and weeds that have been left so long they are growing out of gutters and footpaths . It's time to tidy up Canberra's suburbs and show some pride in the place . So much for 'The Garden City'."
530,615,Dangerous pothole,General,"A hole has opened on the road surface through to a drain. The drains and gutters along the lane do not function, causing the lane to flood."
531,616,Eroded road and inadequate drainage,General,There is a lack of drainage pipes under the road and every time it rains the surface is washed away causing deep ruts in the road. This makes the intersection very dangerous.
532,617,Asbestos,General,Asbestos Has been dumbed outside unit block 8-10 fourth ave Blacktown it has been the for over 3 weeks and there are plenty of children around seems like it has had someone put caution tape around the area but it needs to been cleaned up not have caution tape as this part of the area is near a school and lots of kids

Also Queen st,travelling towards Gordon Parker St is pretty bad too and has been that way for a long time"

544,636,Shrubs and dead trees needing removal,General,I have a number of dead shrubs on the other side of my fence which is next to a lane way. The kids in the neighborhood have been making this a spot to hang out and I'm worried they may end up setting these on fire. These bushes would burn very easily and are only meters from my house. My house is 36 Cartwright St. The lane way is next to me.
545,638,Street needs lighting,General,"Hi, I've been living in benfield pde for almost 4 years now and there has been time I've come late at night and can hardly see my street because it being too dark and not very visible.

My neighbours house just got home invaded and when he escaped her husband chased him but couldn't see where he went because the street is so dark. It's feels very unsafe when the sun starts to set.

Cars speed through the blind corner and I have had many near misses. Many people ignore the no right turn into Shoobra, again at great risk. My driving instructor years ago told me to wind down the window and ""listen"" for oncoming cars! I think (and many neighbours) that it would be appropriate to close the end of Shoobra rd and have a small but attractive park area. There are other streets that have done this and it has been highly successful!"

579,695,Speeding and Road Surface,General,"This is a relatively narrow road with a 50km/h speed limit which is regularly ignored by speeding buses, taxis, motor cyclists and cars. Buses struggle to stay on their own side of the double white line and motorists exiting their parked cars on the north side of the road have little or no room to do so safely because of the width of the road and the speed of oncoming vehicles. Many people park on the north side and cross to enter the Manly/Spit walk opposite No 92. Aside from this, the road surface is poor - no work has been done on it for at least the past 4 years."

The situation is exacerbated by the proximity of a petrol station at the intersection of Summerland Circuit and Drakeford Drive. Given the frequent warnings we are receiving about the dangers from bushfires this coming year, the neglected bush area where so much fuel has accumulated over time is of concern to nearby residents. Finally, I draw your attention to the presence of Namadgi School diagonally opposite to the area identified, a school that would certainly be affected should a fire break out nearby."

595,713,Two large sunk patches,General,"There are two large sunk patches which need to be urgently corrected as this is a very busy area with high traffic where two lanes merge into one in downhill direction. It is very dangerous as drivers so often try to merge and avoid the patches at the same time. Also they cause constants high level of 'pothole-type' noise to the locals, days or nights. But worst thing is all of the local houses around the patches shake everytime there is a big car or truck passing by which can cause permanent structural damage. The patches have been here for a while and there has been an attempt to fix however not correctly as we can see it sunk and the problems got worst. The whole road seem to be resurface but for some reasons this section was left undone. Please see attached photo from Google Earth.

When travelling west on Wyralla at this intersection there is usually one or two cars legally parked on the eastern side of Kent St adjacent to the corner. The problem is that these cars totally obstruct vision of vehicles approaching along Kent St from Boronia Ave to Wyralla resulting in quite a few near misses. There was another significant accident on the intersection this week. It needs Council to install No Stopping signs in the 5m area on the eastern side of Kent St north of Wyralla

608,735,Line marking,General,"Lines have faded on either side of the road to the west of the roundabout. Very dangerous for cyclists approaching or exiting the roundabout. Cars are commonly crossing the fog line putting others at risk. It would be better if the left lane going east was the alternate lane rather than the broken lines being for people turning right. As a cyclist who uses the shoulder until this point, cars regularly cut me off despite me being ahead of them."

618,750,"Potholes in Nowack Ave, have been here for 8 years now",General,"In Nowack Avenue, Umina Beach (NSW 2257... Gosford Council) just where it enters Ocean Beach Road, the surface is completely unacceptable. Most traffic exiting Nowack Avenue turns left and has to roll over some terrible pots and dints. It also floods when it rains even moderately, so you can't even see them ! It has been like this for the 8 years we have lived in this street. This is not an out-of-the-way street either but just a lump of loose bitumen's throw from the CBD"
619,751,Dumped Car,General,Ygf 70p
620,752,Congestion from 4 to 6pm,General,There is minimal traffic flow of an afternoon/evening. Due to a backing up of traffic it will shortly start to block one lane of the M1 north and south bound with people waiting to get through Morisset. With the new housing developments going ahead this will only increase the problem very quickly.
621,755,Traffic Lights,General,"Traffic Lights at the intersection of the New England Highway and South Seas Drive Ashtonfield only four vehicles to make the right hand turn onto the highway on a green light before changing to red.

Please widen the footpath, fix footpath and cut back vegetation."
623,759,Dangerous turn from Jubilee Street,General,"Coming from Jubilee Street turning right into Boundary Road is an extremely dangerous turn when the two car parks from the corner of Boundary and Jubilee in front of the Doctors are used. Due to the road dipping (for drainage) at that corner, as well as the two cars parked in front of the Doctors (especially if large makes, which most are now days) oncoming traffic along Boundary is only visible by coming out onto the roadway and risking coming in front of oncoming traffic. I have a reasonable size ford falcon and due to the dip the front lowers so this adds to the problem. A driver of a smaller and lower vehicle would have no visibility( if two cars are parked on the right) until it came right out nearly into the middle of the roadway. The problem has been reported previously to the Mayor, 6 months ago via a radio phone in."

641,783,Speed limit,General,"All streets on the central coast are 50kph unless signed differently. Why then in the Matcham /Holgate area is it 60kph? Carlton Wattle Tree & Coachwood roads are narrow twisting hilly & have many concealed drive ways. While I accept that council has only so much to spend, surely lowering the speed limit would be an obvious move & cost effective way of making this area so much safer. We have seen many accidents, sadly one a fatality, & even more near misses."

644,788,Road resurfaced,General,Recently the road was resurfaced from Alma Rd to Weinwright Avenue including Patterson Close at Padstow Hts - tar was layed on the existing surface and then stones - amazing that there are more loose stones and gravel on the road which is dangerous for not only drivers but including motor bike riders. Including a section on the left side of the road in Weinwright Avenue appoaching the intersection at Patterson Close has uneven sections where it appears that no repairs have been made but to just put tar over it. Very unsatisfactory job and still waiting for the removal of the loose stones on the road. I wonder why it has taken so long to retify even when contacting the council about this matter. Thank you
645,79,Mirror needed,General,"Coming out of Wheatley Street on to Castleton Crescent, there is a blind corner to the right and people often speed past there. If a mirror were placed opposite the Wheatley St exit, you would be able to see cars heading towards you rather than having to speed out and hope for the best."

647,791,Murrays Run Road is dangerous,General,"Murrays Run Road is 14km of dirt road which provides the ONLY access to Burralong Valley (37 properties), and many other properties on Murrays Run itself. It is currently (and often is, despite occasional grading) dangerous. It's essentially a single-lane road, with numerous blind bends. It is so pot-holed as to be almost unnavigable. Cars are driven to avoid deep potholes, often going around bends on the wrong side of the road. There have been numerous ""near misses""; a crash, with injury and possible death, is inevitable. Council does not grade the road nearly as often as it needs, and often not very well."

This is a serious issue for riders. Implementing a proper ""No Stopping"" zone in both Havilah road approaching Nelson road and In Nelson road would give a better line of sight and a ""Stop Sign"" for traffic from Havilah Road would make the road safer."
658,807,Lane markings,General,"Increasingly, cars are turning right onto Lambton Rd from Curley Rd, using the left hand lane. This compounds traffic congestion when the traffic lights are synchronised for a green left turn arrow to cycle through - a right turning car from left lane can stop a long line of cars from turning left. We just need some turning arrows painted on the lanes here please so that the left lane of Curley Rd is left turn only and the right lane is right turn only. Thanks"

The East Terrace road does not have flashing school zone signs , to alert drivers that school zone speeds are in force. On many occassions motorists speed through the school crossing which also does not have a Lollipop controlled pedestrian crossings. As a result their has been many near misses over the years of both parents and children nearly run over at the crossing. I ask that you raise this matter with council as a high priority.

692,853,Accident prone intersection urgently needs attention.,General,Personally I was in a near fatal T-bone accident. A vehicle running a stop sign travelling about 60kph collided into the drivers door and I was fortunate to have a lucky escape with no serious injury. I live on Park St. about 100 meters from this intersection and see and hear incidents all the time here. I would like to see some form of traffic obstacle to slow traffic down along Redman Street on approach to this intersection. I have also witnessed cars travelling along Park Street coming from Canterbury Road traveling at ridiculous speeds sometimes over 80kph and I would really like to see speed humps put in place to slow them down.

699,865,"U-turn in peak hour traffic, require a no u-turn sign",General,At this intersection there is currently a no U-turn sign at this intersection when diving to athllon drive. When driving to hindmarsh there is no sign and motorists perform a U-turn there to get to the car yards at the end of Melrose drive. As there is no right turn lane (as there is no street to turn right into) I have a few close calls with either nearly running up the back of the car performing the U-turn or cars running into the back of me when I stop dead in the right hand lane. I believe a sign should be at this intersection on both sides of the road.
700,868,Fallen tree,General,"There is a tree that has been fallen onto 5 bayswater st, st johns park nsw 2176. It is now has fully fallen and is blocked half of the road. It was half blown down 2 weeks ago buy the wind."

703,870,Potholes,General,Could the potholes at the lights wattle grove drv & Heathcote rd be repaired north bound
704,872,Please make it an official pedestrian crossing,General,"Front of club rivers rear entrance. Since i have started picking up my kids from st joseph catholic riverwood, we have to dodge traffic coming from both direction since all parking available is on the other side of school."
705,873,Relocate pedestrian crossing on cnr Launceston street and Hindmarsh Drive,General,"The traffic island at the corner of Launceston Street and Hindmarsh Drive in Lyons has the lowered pedestrian crossing too close to the intersection. This means that when cars are waiting to turn right onto Hindmarsh drive, they completely block the crossing, making it difficult for pedestrians and bicycles to cross safely. I suggest moving the crossing at least one car length back, or removing the island completely from one car length back from the intersection to allow others to cross safely."
706,874,Excessive speed in residential area,General,Too often Buses and cars speed down Tremere street as a short cut between Zoeller St and Burwood Road. Traffic calming devices should be put on streets to slow the cars down especially in residential areas where there are kids about
707,876,Traffic signals,General,"The traffic signals installed here have been a waste of time to the community, and are used as a revenue raiser by police."
708,877,Parked Cars make it extremely difficult to make a right-hand turn onto Glebe Road,General,Cars parked outside the business on the corner of King Street and Glebe Road reduce traffic visibility and make it extremely dangerous at times to make a right-hand turn from King Street onto Glebe Road. This is coupled with the fact that Glebe Road curves and climbs at this point making it difficult to see oncoming traffic. I think that parking on Glebe Road at the front of this business should be restricted or prohibited.

The only acknowledgement was from Councillor Michael Platt, who said he would discuss the question of parking restrictions with Council. Subsequently, agenda item:- ""further extension of parking restrictions from the Princes Highway to the vicinity of 264 West Street, Carlton"", was listed for Council's meeting held on Tuesday, 3 December, 2013. Final determination was completed at the next meeting on 9 December, when it was advised that the matter had been referred to the Kogarah Local Traffic Committee and not approved asit was ""not considered in the best interests of all properties in the Street, negatively impacting on parking availability. There are only twelve private residences (six on each side of the street), located between the ""light ""industrial area and the Princes Highway, and parking availability outside all of these homes is nil, due the the impact of parking practices of the occupants and visitors of nearby factory premises, contrary to Council's requirement to provide offstreet parking. incumbent on Council and owners of the industrial premise to resume space inorder to erect a suitable Parking Station, at the joint cost to Council and and a Council Rates Levy on each industrial site owner.

714,890,Parking on Corner - Dangerous Obstruction,General,"When turning right from Garnet Avenue into Grove Street it is necessary to nose out blindly into potential oncoming traffic in order to see if it is clear to turn.

Suggest landscaping corner to prevent parking so close to corner."

728,91,Missing bollard in lane way,General,"Hi guys, several years ago one of the concrete bollards in the lane way beside my house was repaired/replaced with a treated pine bollard. This bollard got knocked out several times and each time I put it back in the ground. The last time I saw it knocked out by the landscape direct mowing contractor and it has been missing ever since. The biggest issue is now the pedestrian access to the reserve has become a vehicle access. This is regularly used by local goons to take their cars and trail bike into the reserve to race them around. This is one of four reserve access points on my street. All the other access points have metal cross over barriers to prevent illegal vehicle access but still allow walkers or bike riders. Could you please have the bollard replace and if possible upgrade the barrier so it matches the rest of the street.o"
