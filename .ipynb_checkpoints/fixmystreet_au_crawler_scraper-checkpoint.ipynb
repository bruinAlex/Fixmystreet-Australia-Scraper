This bollard got knocked out several times and each time I put it back in the ground. The last time I saw it knocked out by the landscape direct mowing contractor and it has been missing ever since. The biggest issue is now the pedestrian access to the reserve has become a vehicle access. This is regularly used by local goons to take their cars and trail bike into the reserve to race them around. This is one of four reserve access points on my street. All the other access points have metal cross over barriers to prevent illegal vehicle access but still allow walkers or bike riders. Could you please have the bollard replace and if possible upgrade the barrier so it matches the rest of the street.o'},\n",

It's dangerous and very scary since our street is so dark we've had people just walk through our yard. My neighbours house just got home invaded and when he escaped her husband chased him but couldn't see where he went because the street is so dark. It's feels very unsafe when the sun starts to set.

Also racing is becoming problematic day and night with footpaths unusable due to illegal parking it is highly dangerous to walk around. Two kids were nearly run over recently from cars going over 80km/hr. Plus a major high speed accident at glassop street intersection involving police and fire dept. A high value quiet street is becoming a hoon's playground due to lack of any traffic management and elderly are unable to walk around. Closing the street off at Marion st would eliminate high speed racing down the hill to time the lights at the highway plus fining illegal parkers. I will also be sending details to the local paper to ensure council takes note and doesn't ignore this.\"},\n",

       "  'comment': 'Morotai road is not very wide. Residents have in the past parked on the nature strips in front of their houses. Recently the police booked all the cars parked on the nature strip. Morotai road is a major thoroughfare to other streets in Revesby height as well as the 926 bus route. Since the police have booked people for parking on the nature strip a number of cars parked in the street have have side mirrors broken by passing vehicles. In addition when cars are parked on either side of the street there is quite often a line of up to 6 cars trying to pass along the street. This causes problems for people trying to reverse out of their driveways. This is particularly problematic given that we have a high number of elderly drivers living in the street. I would suggest that council construct tiled parking areas on the nature strips similar to what exist in sans souci such as in Bonney street. ( see Google street view for details)'},\n",

Including a section on the left side of the road in Weinwright Avenue appoaching the intersection at Patterson Close has uneven sections where it appears that no repairs have been made but to just put tar over it. Very unsatisfactory job and still waiting for the removal of the loose stones on the road. I wonder why it has taken so long to retify even when contacting the council about this matter.

This means that traffic is forced into banking up in one lane instead of two. Whereas previously the traffic would bank up in two lanes up to about Crawford road, because of these traffic islands, the traffic is forced into banking up in one lane and banks up way back up the street to as far as Crawford Public School. This is made worse by the fact that the traffic light sequencing gives traffic in Power street heading west the shortest possible time to go so only 4-5 cars get to go through the green light before it changes again. This intersection is a nightmare of a morning and is also made worse by a dedicated right turn lane which is unnecessary as the majority of traffic goes straight ahead or turns left. The structure of this intersection, the traffic light sequencing and now the new traffic islands all work towards making this intersection a major traffic nightmare and council needs to rethink it completely!'},\n",

We have a black line alogn Metella road which is has an enven surface that looks ugly. The residents in Metella road deserve better than this. I hope that something can be done to correct htis soon, I look forward to Council consideration of this matter. The Residents fo Metella Road Toongabbie NSW thank you\"},\n",

       "  'comment': \"Redfern rd Minto is a wide and safe street with footpaths down both sides. Why then is the actually driving area of the road so restricted and cluttered with obstacles? There are two separate bike paths running down the road to the station - the footpath is marked and signposted as a dedicated cycle lane so the addition of further unused cycle room on the actual road is unnecessary. The roundabouts which are supposed to maintain the flow of traffic are dangerous due to the amount of concrete and obstacles surrounding them. I have seen a couple of near misses there as the attention of drivers is focused on navigating their vehicle through the tight space into the roundabout and not on the roundabout itself, nor on the other traffic in or approaching the roundabout. The Kent st roundabout is particularly bad and I would suggest also not required for this quiet T intersection. The addition of a very aggressive bump in this already restricted and difficult to navigate piece of road takes further attention away from the traffic at the roundabout. This aggressive bump is a 'first gear' bump and further bottle-necks traffic flowing down the road. Traffic can now be backed up from the bump to the school and even the traffic lights, as each driver shifts down to first gear to get through this roundabout. Again, roundabouts are designed to maintain traffic flow. This roundabout is unnecessary and the obstacles around it are distracting and dangerous. The additional aggressive bump at the station is also unnecessary and a further distraction reducing the flow of traffic. The bump is right on the entry to a right angle bend at the station. Cars are already slowing down to second gear to go around the bend and the addition of a first gear bump into the bend is unnecessary, a distraction and dangerous. There is a lot of foot traffic at the station and further distractions in the form of this bump and the concrete bumper lanes are unsafe. One might also ask why the existing concrete median was torn up only to be re-laid the same week?\"},\n",

Wearing sensible low heeled boots and walking at normal speed, and I am surefooted. My right foot twisted over on uneven bitumen close to grass and I fell sideways. I was carrying a bottle in my right hand, it smashed as I landed and I sustained two deep cuts to my left hand which wax extended to protect my fall. That night I had to locate and attend an emergency department at Concord Hospital, the arm was treated superficially and immobilised in a cast as there was glass deeply embedded in a cut; then return to the hospital for the whole of the next day prepped and awaiting a general anaesthetic and plastic surgery to clean the wounds thoroughly and remove a large piece of glass. This affected my holiday; along with shock and discomfort, it meant that I had to change flights, as I was booked to fly to Hobart on Monday but medically unready to fly. I will follow up with the Canada Bay Council as I am unhappy about what happened for myself through no fault of my own, and what could happen for other pedestrians, such as a father I saw walking up the street briskly with his toddler on his shoulders, or frail elders.

The poor truck went onto the other side of the road (thankfully nothing was coming the opposite direction) to stop plowing into the back of me (and causing a multi car pile up).'},\n",

Why did not the council use the standard of the unbroken yellow line along the kerb to delineate the area rather then create more risk by placing signs that both draw attention from the road but also increases risk to cyclists, pedestrians and motorists.

Cars are parked on both sides of the street even though it is not wide enough to carry the sheer volume of traffic due to council approving high density housing yet not providing adequate off street parking. Being close to the university also means foot traffic is high yet there is no foot path but rough and damaged sides. Very run down and over used street.'},\n",

This catches drivers unawares, cuts across traffic and causes merging issues. I have seen and experienced multiple near miss accidents here, as the drivers in right lane do not except someone to be undertaking from the left and then have them immediately turn right. If there were clear arrows marking the direction of turning on ferndell st, this problem would be solved. With left hand traffic only allowed left, and right lane traffic only allowed right.'},\n",
